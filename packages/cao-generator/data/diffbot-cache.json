The FAA has issued a flight restriction halting all flights to and from El Paso effective from February 10 at 11:30 PM (MST) to February 20 at 11:30PM (MST). Travelers should contact their airlines to get most up-to-date flight status information,\" the post said.\nThe airport is served by:\nNeed a news break?

Under the restriction, aircraft are not allowed to fly in the area unless they receive specific authorization from federal officials. It does not affect nearby Mexican airspace.\nAt 2:30 a.m. (local time) Wednesday, Feb. 11, El Paso International Airport appeared nearly deserted. Employees on site said they were unsure what prompted the halt of all flights.\nNoah Velasquez, a Lower Valley resident, was scheduled to depart for New York City at 7 a.m. Like many travelers, he was notified around midnight that his flight had been canceled.\nVelasquez said he and other passengers were among the first to alert American Airlines to the situation at El Paso International Airport.\n“American Airlines wasn’t even notified,” Velasquez said. “We were the ones who told them. It’s very confusing. I don’t know what’s going on either.”\nThe city of El Paso issued a statement on the restriction at 12:35 a.m. Wednesday, Feb. 11.\n\"Airport staff has reached out to the FAA, and we are pending additional guidance,\" according to the city's statement. \"In the meanwhile, commercial airlines operating out of El Paso are being informed of the restriction, which appears to be security related. Travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines to get the latest information on their flight status.\"\nOfficials at El Paso International Airport said they have contacted the FAA and are awaiting additional guidance. Commercial airlines operating out of El Paso are being notified of the restriction.\nWhat to do if your flight is affected by the closure\nTravelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight status and rebooking information.\nIf your flight is affected by the airport closure, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to travel. Airlines will likely try to reaccommodate affected passengers, but El Paso is hundreds of miles from other airports with commercial service.\nAmong the nearest are Albuquerque, New Mexico, at least a three-and-a-half hour drive away, and Tucson, Arizona, about a four-and-a-half hour drive away, according to Google Maps.\nSouthwest Airlines acknowledged the closure in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\"At the direction of the FAA, Southwest has paused all operations to and from El Paso International Airport. We have notified affected Customers and will share additional information as it becomes available. Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees,\" the statement said.\nThe airline did not specify how customers were being reaccommodated.

Chief executive Vinai Venkatesham is expected to make a longer statement later on Wednesday.\nSources say Venkatesham recommended the decision to the ownership on Tuesday night after the game as Tottenham's dreadful run of form continued and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium witnessed another toxic evening.\nSpurs have won just two of their last 17 league matches -- taking 11 points in that time -- and the current winless run of eight games is their longest in the Premier League since October 2008.\nSources say Spurs were reluctant to make a change due to an acknowledgment that many issues at the club pre-date Frank and he has been unfortunate to suffer the volume of injuries he has.\nLast season, under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs finished 17th in the league but won their first trophy in 17 years, lifting the Europa League in May after beating Manchester United 1-0 in the final.\nBut Frank only oversaw a modest initial improvement in form, narrowly losing the UEFA Super Cup Final to Paris Saint-Germain before winning six of their opening 16 league games.\nSpurs' transfer spending\n2015-16 to 2025-26\n2015-162016–172017–182018–192019–202020–212021–222022–232023–242024–252025-26£0m£50m£100m£150m£200m£250m£300m£229.91m£229.91m£160.72m£160.72m£235.98m£235.98m£155.95m£155.95m£83.14m£83.14m£95.77m£95.77m£130.49m£130.49m£0m£0m£104.91m£104.91m£72.27m£72.27m£61.45m£61.45m\nSource: Transfermarkt\nAnd the board felt compelled to act as Tottenham are now in danger of relegation as they sit just five points above the drop zone.\nFrank guided Spurs to the Champions League round-of-16 after finishing fourth in the group stage but the club's results were too disappointing to ignore.\nThey were beaten in the EFL Cup fourth round by Newcastle and the FA Cup third round by Aston Villa. They had won just two league games at home all season and the negative atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was compounded by off-field issues with captain Cristian Romero criticising the club's hierarchy in a social media post just minutes after the transfer window closed.\nIt is the first sacking of the post-Daniel Levy era at Spurs.

For patients, it means longer waits at the doctor's office and appointment headaches. For clinics, it means they can see fewer patients, jeopardizing their bottom line.\nA new report from the healthcare education platform Covista found that hospital leaders are falling noticeably short in filling positions across the US — especially in roles people seek out most, such as primary care.\n\"We're looking at dramatic shortages as we move forward for nurses, physicians, and allied health professionals,\" Steve Beard, chair and CEO of Covista, told Business Insider.\nThere are far more healthcare job openings than available workers\nHealthcare is among the few sectors of the job market that are actively growing. Over 702,000 healthcare job vacancies are posted each month, with only 306,000 unemployed workers nationwide available to fill them, according to a February report from Covista and Gallup. Researchers surveyed 1,347 clinicians and 167 healthcare executives across all 50 states.\nIt's a challenge unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts the US workforce will be short thousands of workers every year over the next decade. In 2026, America needs more than 1 million medical professionals, but only about 960,000 are actively employed in the field. Demand will balloon as baby boomers age and need short- or long-term care.\nBeard said that primary care providers and specialists, the \"linchpin\" of preventive medicine, are the most difficult positions for clinics to fill. Demand for allied health providers — including ultrasound techs, lab techs, radiologists, and similar roles — also far exceeds supply.\nThis is especially true in less populated areas: 85% of rural healthcare executives surveyed by Covista said they can't find enough local talent, while only 45% reported the same challenge in cities. And, because healthcare is such a fast-moving, hands-on job, few of those surveyed felt that AI is tangibly alleviating staff shortages.\n\"​​There's just no substitute for the role that human beings play in helping people heal, recover and grow,\" Beard said. He added that healthcare workers \"aren't fungible. They are critically important to what the experience is for all Americans who rely on the US healthcare system.\"\nWorker shortages are also part of a bigger problem facing America's hospitals. Dwindling funding, federal changes to Medicaid, and shrinking small-town populations have led to the closure of hundreds of hospitals since 2010. The majority of those are in rural areas, with nearly 800 more rural hospitals currently at risk of closure due to financial challenges.\nOthers that remain open have stopped inpatient care, limiting critical access to emergency rooms, labor and delivery units, and mental health support — medical specialties that can require round-the-clock staffing. In an intensive care unit, for example, at least one nurse must be on shift for every two patients.\nThere may still be good news for hospital hiring managers: Enrollment in US medical schools grew last year, and nursing school enrollment is rebounding from a dip in 2022. Though Beard said that it will take time to build up that workforce in rural areas, and incentivize them to stay there.\n\"An important part of the solution here is that we can actually train clinical talent in the markets where they live and work,\" he said.","wordCount":581},"cachedAt":1770812880711},"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-it-wont-negotiate-over-its-missile-capabilities-2026-02-11/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812883138},"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-11/la-county-sheriff-firefighter-pay-ballot-measure":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812883140},"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl5k6ygk57o":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812883143},"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/council-europe-strips-former-head-immunity-over-epstein-probe-2026-02-11/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812883143},"https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-gunman-opens-fire-at-school/a-75910275":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812883144},"https://7news.com.au/news/investors-flock-to-gold-and-silver-despite-erratic-prices-amid-international-conflicts-and-inflation-fears-c-21544985":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812887152},"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15549481/gunman-takes-students-teachers-hostage-school-thailand-shooting-staff-pupils.html":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812887152},"https://www.fastcompany.com/91485939/elon-musks-x-offices-paris-raided-french-prosecutors-heres-why":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812898327},"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/south-korea-launches-landmark-laws-to-regulate-ai-startups-warn-of-compliance-burdens":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770812904755},"https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/opinion/pipelinepress-02032026":{"data":{"date":"Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:08:00 GMT","siteName":"MortgageNewsDaily","imageUrl":"https://a.mortgagenewsdaily.com/dsocial/6981f709663ce01de0b38156/6981f709663ce01de0b38156_0_2026020316.jpg","text":"Regarding rate movement, the bond market often does the Fed’s job for it, and so whatever the Fed’s Open Market Committee actually does is almost an afterthought.

While Fed headlines generate noise, Treasury yields and MBS spreads continue to define what policy can realistically do. The takeaway is clear. Watch the bond market, not the commentary. In every cycle, understanding the mechanics behind rate movement matters more than reacting to the news.\nMortgage Standards Matter!\nWhy does the Innovation Investment Fee spark so much confusion? And why does it matter more than most lenders realize? The answer sits at the quiet center of the industry: standards that work best when you don’t notice them but cost you dearly when they fall apart. From “checkers checking the checkers” to hidden operational drag, the real ROI of MISMO isn’t flashy revenue, writes Brian Vieaux in the latest #VieauxPoint on the Chrisman Commentary website. Its friction avoided, trust restored, and time given back. The article pulls back the curtain on what MISMO actually does, why vendors aren’t the whole story, and why investing upstream may be the cheapest decision lenders can make.\nBrian writes, “If you’d like to go deeper, and hear directly from industry executives on why their organizations support MISMO through the IIF, I invite you to join an upcoming webinar dedicated exclusively to this topic.

STRATMOR has been working with several firms to help them rethink their current org structures. This is a process that is all too often overlooked or ignored, particularly among small and mid-size firms. This process helps clarify individual leadership roles and responsibilities, personal strengths, spans of control and the personal interests. The output and recommendations are designed to help improve alignment, performance, engagement, and communication within the firm, all critical elements of a high functioning leadership team. Note: this work also helps build a roadmap to support potential succession opportunities and eventual retirements… another topic that is all too often ignored. Investment in tech is important but investment in people is critical. Contact STRATMOR, or connect with David Hrobon at the IMB Conference at Amelia Island this week to learn more.\nIf You’re Not at the IMB\nThe mood is good! Monday at IMB included a lot of chatter about credit costs (including MBA President Bob Broeksmit railing against them in his keynote speech). Attendance is solid, lenders outnumber vendors, and people in general are happy to see one another again before the fatigue of the conference circuit inevitably takes its toll later this year.\nOne cloud is the valuations of lenders. Bloomberg reported that mortgage company stocks tumbled Friday after PennyMac Financial Services Inc.’s reported profits that were significantly below Wall Street’s expectations, dampening the outlook for other lenders as the industry is squeezed by increasing competition.\n“The company’s shares closed down 33 percent at $99.92 on Friday, wiping out nearly $2.6 billion from their market value, after its fourth quarter per-share profit came in at $1.97, compared with the more than $3 expected by analysts. The miss was driven by borrowers paying off their loans faster than expected, which exerted a drag on its income. ‘The company noted it was surprised by the level of paydowns in the period, and tight competition is driving tighter margins and challenging the recapture effort,’ BTIG analyst Eric Hagen wrote in a note. The weakness spilled over to other mortgage lenders, with shares of Rocket Companies Inc. and UWM Holdings Corporation sinking 14 percent. Onity Group Inc. fell 5.7 percent, loanDepot Inc. dropped 6.4 percent.”\nCapital Markets\nMarkets have largely shrugged off last week’s Fed decision, instead reacting more sharply to the announcement of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, given his hawkish track record and conservative stance on rates and the balance sheet (a Fed more focused on inflation control could ultimately support lower long-term yields). February kicked off with stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data, including a sharp upside surprise in the ISM index that pushed yields to new recent highs, particularly at the long end.\nThe Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey showed tighter standards for commercial lending but mixed demand trends, with little change expected in lending conditions through 2026. For now, attention has shifted back to incoming labor market data, which is likely to be the primary driver of Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and expectations for the timing of future rate cuts. Speaking of which, the BLS announced a delay to January’s jobs report due to the government shutdown.\nTreasury weakness reflects seasonal pressures and a knee-jerk reaction to Kevin Warsh’s nomination, driven less by hawk-versus-dove debates than by expectations that he will avoid using the Fed’s balance sheet to cap long-term yields. Markets now see policy as firmly data-dependent, with modest easing priced through June, a March cut largely off the table, and labor data set to be the decisive factor for Warsh’s first FOMC meeting. In the meantime, investors are leaning more heavily on private data amid strong financial conditions, elevated asset prices, and lingering uncertainty around growth, tariffs, and the resilience of the U.S. consumer, all of which reinforce the Fed’s patient stance on further rate cuts.\nThe U.S. MBS market started 2026 on strong footing, delivering 52 basis points of excess return in January, one of the best January performances in nearly four decades. The excess return was supported by a stable yield curve, low volatility, and steady issuance. Ginnie Mae 30-year securities led the sector with a 69-basis point excess return, extending their outperformance over the past three months, while Fannie Mae 15-year paper lagged amid a sharp increase in supply. Spreads tightened across 30-year products, valuations are now near their tightest since early 2022, and February’s historically favorable seasonality adds a supportive backdrop despite limited room for further tightening. Within the stack, performance favored select coupons and low pay-up spec stories, while prepayment activity is expected to remain contained, with higher coupons and reactive recent vintages continuing to drive most of the action.\nToday’s economic calendar is already under way with remarks from Richmond Fed President Barkin. Later today brings Redbook same store sales and some short-duration Treasury auctions. JOLTS for December were supposed to be reported but have been cancelled due to the partial government shutdown. Overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia was out with its latest decision, surprising markets by holding its cash target rate at 3.60 percent. Quarterly earnings also continue from wall street. We begin Tuesday with Agency MBS prices little changed from Monday’s close, the 2-year yielding 3.57, and the 10-year yielding 4.30 after closing yesterday at 4.28 percent.","wordCount":2279},"cachedAt":1770812916340},"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/market-outlook/2026/01/12/market-outlook-trump-powell-tensions-put-spotlight-on-rates-stocks-and-ai-growth/":{"data":{"author":"BNN Bloomberg","date":"Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:41:00 GMT","siteName":"BNN Bloomberg","imageUrl":"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/resizer/v2/YZIOX2ZISVERXEXM2HDAYDUHMY.jpg?auth=ffe793d673a1f8b6b2fa4d389157c82be615382a9704ecf5ba3225513a76b8e1&width=1440&height=689","text":"Tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell escalated after the administration opened a criminal investigation into the central bank chief, raising fresh questions about monetary policy independence and investor confidence.\nBNN Bloomberg spoke with Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at CapWealth, about how political pressure on the Federal Reserve, shifting interest-rate expectations and heavy capital spending tied to artificial intelligence are shaping U.S. equities and economic growth.\nKey Takeaways\nLeadership in U.S. stocks remains heavily concentrated, making company-specific selection more important than broad index exposure.\nSofter inflation trends and additional government revenue from tariffs have reduced pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep rates elevated.\nCooling employment conditions are pushing policymakers toward a more dovish stance, increasing expectations for rate cuts into 2026.\nMassive capital demands from the AI buildout are tightening liquidity, strengthening the case for ending quantitative tightening.\nAI investment is expected to drive long-term U.S. prosperity, but near-term gains tied to data centres and grid expansion must translate into productivity growth.\nRead the full transcript below:\nANDREW: Friction between U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is reaching new heights today after the Trump administration opened a criminal investigation into the Fed chair. Let’s get more from Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at CapWealth. Tim, thanks very much for joining us. What’s your reaction to people saying this is unprecedented — a criminal probe of a Fed chair?\nTIM: Well, I think you have to put it in perspective. This was a referral to a grand jury, and the grand jury system in the United States is designed, to some extent, to depoliticize the process, especially in a case like this. Evidence will be presented, and whether an indictment comes out of the grand jury remains to be seen. At this point, it’s largely out of the hands of the administration, beyond the evidence presented by the Justice Department to determine whether to move forward.\nANDREW: So technically, the Department of Justice has subpoenaed the central bank and is threatening a criminal indictment?\nTIM: The threat of a criminal indictment comes from the fact that they’ve opened a criminal investigation. So yes, that’s technically correct. I was a little surprised by how quickly the Fed chair reacted. I would have thought it would have been more appropriate to make those statements after the grand jury had completed its work, rather than further politicizing the situation.\nANDREW: Is this a threat — and I know it’s a cliché — to the credibility of the Fed? Does it really have implications for how global investors see the U.S.?\nTIM: I think absolutely you want an independent Fed. But there’s also a lot of precedent in American history for presidents being unhappy with Federal Reserve chairs. That goes back to Lyndon Johnson and even earlier. So part of this is simply American history, and part of it is Trump’s personality and the way he operates. We’ll have to let it play out.\nANDREW: Let’s look at U.S. stocks more broadly. The S&P 500 hit a record high at the end of last week. The so-called Magnificent Seven are not back at record highs, but you still think the market is too heavily weighted in about 15 to 20 companies.\nTIM: Yes, and I think the focus in the first quarter will be on earnings. The question is whether earnings growth will be enough to sustain gains and bring new leadership into the market. It will be harder for the Magnificent Seven, given their massive capital expenditure commitments, to really move the needle on earnings as they go through this transition and try to monetize their significant investments in AI.\nANDREW: Let’s turn to AI. You’ve said we’ve seen this movie before, to some extent, with the railway boom of the 1800s.\nTIM: Yes. And I’m quick to remind people that if you read The House of Morgan, J.P. Morgan went to Europe to negotiate loans with the Rothschilds during that period, and they threw him out of their office. They told him to go home and said they wouldn’t lend a single dollar. That set off a consolidation process after the boom. Railroads eventually became connected commerce systems, and economic activity moved from one end of the country to the other, leading to a remarkable period of prosperity. I think there will be shades of that with AI. There won’t be 100 per cent winners. There will be losers, and that’s part of the creative destruction process in a free economy.\nANDREW: So there’s a real prospect that a number of data centres could be built and end up as white elephants, at least in the short term?\nTIM: I think that’s possible. We really don’t know yet. The construction boom is happening now, but the real test will come in late 2027, 2028 and 2029, when these centres come online. There’s still massive spending required on electricity, grid upgrades and connectivity to handle the enormous amounts of data being transferred. There’s a lot of growth and stimulus still to come, but whether some projects prove unnecessary or get consolidated is something we likely won’t know for several years.\nANDREW: We’re hearing that U.S. voters are unhappy about rising electricity bills, and politicians from both parties are taking heat. Data centres are often blamed as one factor.\nTIM: You can spread the blame around. Look at the situation in California, for example, where there’s roughly US$50 billion in cleanup work related to power lines. There’s also been reluctance to pass along rate increases or allow utilities to recover reasonable costs. Some utilities have been behind the curve for years and were always going to need substantial investment to upgrade their grids. All of that costs money, and consumers ultimately feel it.\nANDREW: Tim, we’ll have to leave it there. Thanks very much.\nTIM: Thank you. Happy New Year.\nANDREW: Happy New Year.

They have also summoned billionaire owner Elon Musk for questioning.\nX and Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI also face intensifying scrutiny from Britain’s data privacy regulator, which opened formal investigations into how they handled personal data when they developed and deployed Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok.\nGrok, which was built by xAI and is available through X, sparked global outrage last month after it pumped out a torrent of sexualized nonconsensual deepfake images in response to requests from X users.\nThe French investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors’ cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a statement. It’s looking into alleged “complicity” in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.\nProsecutors asked Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend “voluntary interviews” on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023 until July 2025.\nIn a post on its own service denying the allegations, X railed against the raid on its Paris office as “an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals rooted in the fair and impartial administration of justice.”\nIn a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors’ office announced the ongoing searches at the company’s offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.\n“At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,” the prosecutors’ statement said.\nEuropean Union police agency Europol “is supporting the French authorities in this,” Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told the AP, without elaborating.\nFrench authorities opened their investigation after reports from a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X likely distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.\nIt expanded after Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust, a crime in France, and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said.\nGrok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were designed for “disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus” rather than for mass murder — language long associated with Holocaust denial.\nIn later posts on X, the chatbot reversed itself and acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, saying it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B was used to kill more than 1 million people in Auschwitz gas chambers.\nThe chatbot also appeared to praise Adolf Hitler last year, in comments that X took down after complaints.\nIn Britain, the Information Commissioner’s Office said it’s looking into whether X and xAI followed the law when processing personal data and whether Grok had any measures in place to prevent its use to generate “harmful manipulated images.”\n“The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” said William Malcolm, an executive director at the watchdog.\nHe didn’t specify what the penalty would be if the probe found the companies didn’t comply with data protection laws.\nA separate investigation into Grok launched last month by the U.K. media regulator, Ofcom, is ongoing.\nOfcom said Tuesday it’s still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months.\nX has also been under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc’s executive arm opened an investigation last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.\nBrussels has already hit X with a 120-million euro (then-$140 million) fine for shortcomings under the bloc’s sweeping digital regulations, including blue checkmarks that broke the rules on “deceptive design practices” that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.\nOn Monday, Musk ’s space exploration and rocket business, SpaceX, announced that it acquired xAI in a deal that will also combine Grok, X and his satellite communication company Starlink.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Nicolas Vaux-Montagny in Lyon, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, Sylvia Hui and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.","wordCount":772},"cachedAt":1770812989218},"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/11/house-vote-trump-tariffs/":{"data":{"author":"Riley Beggin","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:08:01 GMT","siteName":"Washington Post","imageUrl":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G3V7H6DRILTLSA4IZJZUSQPNGA_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440&impolicy=high_res","text":"The vote opens the door to consideration of measures that would end the national emergency Trump declared to justify sweeping tariffs on other countries’ imports.\nFebruary 11, 2026 at 7:08 a.m. EST\nThe House has rejected an attempt to block votes that would end the national emergency underpinning President Donald Trump’s tariffs, opening the controversial policy up for challenges for the first time in nearly a year.","wordCount":67},"cachedAt":1770816553202},"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2026/02/11/nancy-guthrie-elder-safety/88611871007/":{"data":{"author":"Kathleen Wong","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:45:00 GMT","siteName":"USA Today","text":"The rare and frightening case is prompting families nationwide to reassess safety systems for elderly parents living independently.\nThe mother of \"Today\" anchor Savannah Guthrie, Nancy Guthrie, was kidnapped from her Arizona home.\nThe incident highlights safety concerns for the 27% of U.S. adults over 60 who live alone.\nExperts recommend a mix of technology and regular check-ins to balance safety and independence for elderly relatives.\nThe kidnapping of \"Today\" anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother is sending shockwaves through the nation. The family is holding out hope for her safe return, while raising concerns for people about the safety of their own elderly loved ones living alone.\nThe search for Nancy Guthrie, 84, has just surpassed its 10th day, with authorities releasing images and videos of a masked and \"armed\" individual appearing to tamper with Guthrie's Nest doorbell cameras the morning she was taken.\nThe 84-year-old was last seen Jan. 31 when family members dropped her off at her home in Tucson, Arizona, after a game night. After she failed to show up for church the next morning, her family went to her house to check on her. When they couldn't find her, they reported her missing.\nIn the search for their mother, the NBC anchor and her siblings have issued emotional public statements asking for her safety and to bring her back home. They've offered to pay unverified ransom notes sent to media outlets, stressing their mother's need for her daily heart medication.\n\"We will not rest,\" Guthrie said to her mother on Feb. 4 in an Instagram video. \"Your children will not rest until we are together again.\"\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\nGuthrie's situation is frightening and rare, but it sheds light on the safety concerns of our elderly loved ones, especially for family members who don't live with or near them. In the U.S., 27% of adults aged 60 or older live alone, higher than in other parts of the world, according to 2020 Pew Research Center data.\nFrom accidents such as falling to developing Alzheimer's disease, seniors who live alone can face challenges, and many of their family members want to do their best in keeping them as safe as possible – even from far away.\n\"As our population ages and cognitive difficulties become more common, these sorts of issues come to the forefront. Sadly, I think this is not something that is as isolated as it used to be,\" said Dr. Jacob Blumenthal, a physician specializing in geriatrics and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"Being attentive, remaining mindful and planning ahead like a good Boy Scout is the best defense.\"\nWith the right tools and vigilance, people can set up effective systems to protect their aging loved ones.\nWhat went wrong with the safety measures already in place?\nNancy Guthrie's home was safeguarded by a Nest doorbell camera, a common security option for many Americans. According to authorities, her camera was disconnected at 1:47 a.m. the morning she went missing. At 2:12 a.m., smart home software detected someone on the camera. At first, video footage of the potential suspect wasn't available under Guthrie's subscription plan, but it was recovered by authorities and private-sector partners.\nThese types of security cameras help many people feel their homes are safer and can strengthen a broader security system, especially for seniors who live alone. While cameras may record or alert if a door or window is opened, they won't prevent someone with dementia from wandering away from the house.\nA multifaceted system of smart home technology, including not only cameras but also smart sensors that lock doors, windows or drawers via a phone app, can offer greater safety benefits, according to Emily Nabors, associate director of innovation at the National Council on Aging (NCOA). A long-distance caregiver could hook their phone to the sensors and be alerted to open doors, or can actively lock one from another location.\nWhat does it really mean to keep our elders safe?\nElder safety encompasses many aspects of welfare beyond just good health. This includes medications, risk of falling, mobility, vision and balance.\nThen there's mental health, plus the importance of social connection and the ability to do things they enjoy with loved ones or participate in their community. Loneliness and isolation have been linked to heart disease, dementia and other medical conditions.\nSafety and security also play a role, from a home free of hazards to AI phone scams that are becoming more prevalent among older generations.\nAs families evaluate their elderly relatives' needs and risks, they should keep in mind that letting their senior maintain their autonomy can also make a big difference in their well-being. \"It's important to balance risk with independence,\" Nabors added. Allowing people to keep doing some tasks on their own, like brushing their teeth, is critical for keeping their sense of self in the world.\nHow can families assess an elderly parent's level of risk?\nFamily members should watch for warning signs of common medical conditions in aging adults, such as dementia. \"Generally, we think of more routine things, like maybe they're burning themselves, or they are not paying their checks, and getting confused about things, little things are coming up, maybe not meeting their friends,\" said Katherine Ornstein, professor in the School of Nursing at Johns Hopkins and director for the Center for Equity in Aging.\nTheir type of home situation also plays a role in an elderly person's safety risk. \"The other issue that's relevant to the Nancy Guthrie situation, which I've been thinking about, is just older adults living alone – and that is a huge issue, that's not uncommon,\" Ornstein continued.\nWhen an older person lives alone, it can be difficult for families to assess their risk because they don't see them on a daily basis. Divvying up regular visits and check-ins among family members means someone is always observing and with them, while providing much-needed social connection.\nNCOA offers home safety checklists for families to assess whether their loved ones' environment is set up to support them, such as removing other hazards.\nAn occupational therapist can also be helpful by evaluating how they interact with their home and make recommendations, such as a shower bench if they're struggling to bathe.\nIn case you missed: She was raising kids while traveling non-stop to care for her parents. It's not uncommon.\nWhat low-tech solutions are most effective for seniors living alone?\nIt depends on their needs, which can change over time, but here are some suggestions from experts on elderly care:\nMedical alert devices such as Life Alert help seniors get emergency assistance even if no one is around or they can't reach out for help by phone, according to Ornstein.\nIf someone with dementia tends to wander off, Blumenthal recommends posting simple signs around the house reminding them not to exit the house or including a phone number for a trusted family member. These can \"cue\" the senior before they leave.\nID bracelets are useful in identifying someone if they do manage to wander out of their home, and smartphones also have location-tracking that loved ones can be connected to.\nEasy home modifications such as nightlights, grab bars and anti-slip mats in the shower can reduce the risk of injury.\nSenior-focused programs like Meals on Wheels provide food, social interaction and check-ins on elders who live alone.\nHow do you set up safety systems if your parent lives in another state?\nIt can be nerve-wracking to be a long-distance caregiver, but technology allows people to stay connected from miles away. It's about finding what works for your family.\nCaregivers can monitor their loved ones with indoor cameras, provided there are discussions about any privacy issues. These cameras also often have speakers and microphones so families can communicate with each other in real time if they see something.\nAlarms for doors and windows, smart locks or wearables that detect movement are other options that boost safety and can connect to the caregiver's smartphones.\nIn some cases, enlisting a trusted neighbor or doctor into an emergency plan is helpful, but it's \"very personal and individualized,\" according to Blumenthal.\nContinued conversations and having loved ones work together are the key to supporting their senior. \"You want to protect them, but you also want to respect their independence and it is a delicate balance,\" he said.","wordCount":1406},"cachedAt":1770816553216},"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/world/canada/canada-shooting-tumbler-ridge-british-columbia.html":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816555680},"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/olympic-medals-gold-precious-metal-prices":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816555680},"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3343217/el-paso-texas-airport-grounds-all-flights-due-special-security-reasons-10-days":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816555680},"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/europe/sturla-holm-laegreid-cheating-olympics-girlfriend-b2918045.html":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816555681},"https://time.com/7377621/stonewall-national-monument-new-york-officials-pride-flag-removed-trump-administration/":{"data":{"author":"Chad de Guzman","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT","siteName":"Time","imageUrl":"https://time.com/redesign/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.time.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2Fstonewall-riots.jpg%3Fquality%3D85%26w%3D1024&w=3840&q=75","text":"New York officials plan to re-raise a rainbow Pride flag at the Stonewall National Monument in Manhattan after the Trump Administration removed it in recent days from the site known for kickstarting the modern LGBT rights movement.\nManhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, an openly gay Democrat, posted a video on X on Tuesday evening, showing where the flag was supposed to be and saying, “Our community is not going to stand by idly as the Trump Administration tries to erase our history.” Hoylman-Sigal said that he and other officials would reinstall the flag at the monument at 4 p.m. Thursday.\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, also a Democrat, similarly said he was “outraged” over the flag’s removal. “New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,” Mamdani posted on social media. “Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it.”\nJulie Menin, speaker of the city council, and other councilmembers wrote a letter to the acting director of the National Park Service, the federal agency overseeing monuments, on Tuesday to express “extreme concern” over the flag’s removal from what they said was “sacred ground in the history of civil rights” and to demand the flag’s immediate return.\nGovernor Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, in a post on X criticized the Trump Administration for first diminishing transgender history from the monument—last year, the National Park Service’s website pages on Stonewall omitted references to transgender and queer individuals and even shortened the acronym to LGB to refer to the community—and then, removing the Pride flag. “I will not let this Administration rollback the rights we fought so hard for,” Hochul said.\nAdvertisement\nOther Democratic lawmakers from New York also slammed the flag’s removal: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the “deeply outrageous action” and said it “must be reversed right now,” and Rep. Jerry Nadler, who advocated for federal recognition of the site before former President Barack Obama designated it a national monument in 2016, called the move another “disgusting example of the Trump Administration's effort to erase the LGBTQ+ community” and added that he “will fight to see that the Pride flag is raised again.”\nDemonstrators also protested Tuesday evening at the park. “My business partners and I bought that bar 20 years ago so something like this would never happen,” said Stacy Lentz, co-owner of the Stonewall Inn. “Taking that flag down is an attempt to erase a part of the American struggle and the American story that LGBTQ folks did to make sure that we have equality.” Pride flags at the Stonewall Inn itself—a gay bar that became a symbol of LGBT resistance after an early morning police raid in June 1969 prompted riots against authorities in protest of anti-LGBT discrimination—remain up, but the symbol was removed from the national monument site across the street, which was first reported by Gay City News.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, the Department of the Interior, the National Park Service’s parent agency, said that “under government-wide guidance, including General Services Administration policy and Department of the Interior direction, only the U.S. flag and other congressionally or departmentally authorized flags are flown on NPS-managed flagpoles, with limited exceptions. Any changes to flag displays are made to ensure consistency with that guidance.”\nThe guidance stems from a Jan. 21 department memo stating that “only the U.S. Flag, flags of the DOI, and the POW/MIA flag will be flown by the NPS” in spaces the National Park Service manages. But the memo provides some exemptions, including flags that “provide historical context,” those that are “part of historic reenactments or living history programs,” among others.\nTIME did not receive an immediate response from the Interior Department on how it would respond to local officials re-raising the flag.\nAdvertisement\nThe changes to the Stonewall Monument come as the Administration has made significant changes to national parks as well as to curb what it views as diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts across the government.\nDuring Trump’s first term in 2017, the Interior Department actually denied that a flagpole near the national monument was on federal land and did not participate in a flag-raising ceremony for the Pride flag. The city instead flew its own Pride flag there, which still remains in place, ABC News reported. During the Biden Administration in 2022, a new federal flagpole was installed at the site and the Pride flag that has since been taken down was officially raised on it.","wordCount":759},"cachedAt":1770816556554},"https://time.com/7377620/doj-grand-jury-slotkin-goodlander-kelly-indictment-illegal-orders-trump/":{"data":{"author":"Miranda Jeyaretnam","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT","siteName":"Time","imageUrl":"https://time.com/redesign/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.time.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2Ftrump-winter.jpg%3Fquality%3D85%26w%3D1024&w=3840&q=75","text":"A federal grand jury on Tuesday declined to indict Democratic lawmakers who urged troops to “refuse illegal orders,” stymieing the Trump Administration’s effort to penalize the Democrats in what some have called a “politicized investigation.”\nThe Justice Department had sought the indictment over a 90-second video from November featuring six Democrats who warned that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home.” The lawmakers in the video, all of whom had served in the military or in intelligence roles, called on members of the military and intelligence community not to comply with unlawful orders.\nService members are only required to follow orders that are lawful and have a duty to disobey commands that are patently unlawful, according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nRead More: Is It ‘Seditious’ or ‘Illegal’ to Urge the Military to Refuse Unlawful Orders? Legal Experts Weigh In\nOn Tuesday evening, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D, Mich.), one of the lawmakers in the video, posted, “Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed. Hopefully, this ends this politicized investigation for good.”\nIt is not clear how many or which of the lawmakers U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro had sought to indict, although Slotkin said she was one of them\nThe attempt to indict her was “in response to me organizing a 90-second video that simply quoted the law,” Slotkin said. “Pirro did this at the direction of President Trump, who said repeatedly that I should be investigated, arrested, and hanged for sedition.”\nAdvertisement\nPresident Donald Trump had accused the lawmakers of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” in a November post on Truth Social. In another post, he called for the lawmakers to be arrested.\n“President Trump continues to weaponize our justice system against his perceived enemies. It’s the kind of thing you see in a foreign country, not in the United States we know and love,” Slotkin added Tuesday.\nRep. Maggie Goodlander (D, N.H.), who also appeared in the video, told Axios on Tuesday, “Today an American grand jury honored our Constitution by standing up to an outrageous abuse of presidential power and taxpayer dollars. No matter the threats, I will keep doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution.”\nThe video also featured Reps. Jason Crow (D, Colo.), Chris Deluzio (D, Penn.), and Chrissy Houlahan (D, Penn.), and Sen. Mark Kelly (D, Ariz.).\nTIME has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutions against perceived political adversaries\nSeveral of the Democratic lawmakers in the video, as well as others, have criticized the Justice Department’s probe. Slotkin and Houlahan said last week they would not comply with the investigation.\nIn a Feb. 5 video posted on X, Slotkin accused the Trump Administration of “purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up” and “deter others from speaking out against their Administration.”\n“The intimidation is the point, and I’m not going to go along with that,” Slotkin said.\nHoulahan said in her own video posted on X the same day that she would refuse to submit to a DOJ request for a voluntary interview. “What is happening now crosses a line when the power of the federal government is turned toward intimidating people,” Houlahan said.\nSlotkin, Houlahan, Crow, and Goodlander confirmed last month that they had been contacted by federal prosecutors. The FBI had also requested interviews with the lawmakers in November. According to NBC, which first reported the declination to indict, the government attorneys assigned to the case are political appointees.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, Arizona’s Kelly sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense for taking administrative actions to demote and censure him over the video. A federal judge is expected to rule on the case soon.\nRead More: ‘What Changed, Pete?’: Democrats Call Out Hegseth Hypocrisy Over ‘Unlawful Orders’ Remark\nHistorically, investigations involving sitting Congressmembers would require oversight and approval from the DOJ’s Public Integrity Section, which is meant to serve as a check on the potential use of the department’s for political ends. The Trump Administration, however, has largely stripped the unit of power.","wordCount":701},"cachedAt":1770816556820},"https://time.com/7377586/2026-winter-olympics-ilia-malinin-figure-skating-men-short-program/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816559686},"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47895570/chloe-kim-no-drama-run-olympic-halfpipe-qualifying":{"data":{"author":"Associated Press","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:10:00 GMT","siteName":"ESPN","imageUrl":"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0211%2Fr1613593_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","text":"Share\nCopy Link\nEmail\nPrint\n LikeOpen Extended Reactions\n9\nReactions\n Like\n9\nLIVIGNO, Italy -- Chloe Kim got the drama over early in Olympic halfpipe qualifying Wednesday, nailing her first run on the way to a top finish and a spot in the final as she goes for her third straight gold medal.\nKim showed no signs of rust in her first contest since injuring her shoulder four weeks ago -- a setback that jeopardized her status as the favorite coming into the Milan Cortina Games.\nIn fact, this looked like most halfpipe contests involving Kim over the years: She jumped higher and did tougher tricks than pretty much everyone, and her execution was close to flawless.\nKim's score of 90.25 in her first run was 2.5 better than Japan's Sara Shimizu and 4.25 better than Kim's American teammate Maddie Mastro.\nThe contest was halted for about 10 minutes when China's Liu Jiayu took a nasty fall toward the bottom of the halfpipe.

One message indicates that a few seconds after sending the reports from the South East Asia visits, the former prince then sent a second batch of files called \"Overseas bids\".\nThese seem to be \"Zip files\" that usually contain many compressed pieces of information.\nThe Afghan document, which is in the Epstein files, was compiled by UK government officials specifically for the then Duke of York.\nIt provides an extensive overview of investment opportunities in Helmand province, at a time when the UK was militarily and politically committed to rebuilding Afghanistan.\nAs Andrew said in his note to Epstein, it's a \"confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province\".\nIt was a briefing produced for Andrew - who was trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 - in the same month that he visited Helmand, where he saw UK troops based there.\nIt gives an assessment of the current local economy and the business opportunities, including \"significant high value mineral deposits\" and the \"potential for low cost extraction\".\nThis includes valuable natural resources such as marble, gold, iridium, uranium and thorium and also possible deposits of oil and gas, with the information prepared by UK government officials, working for the Helmand reconstruction team.\nAccording to official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.\nSir Vince, who was seen as instrumental in ending Andrew's time as trade envoy, called for more transparency on Andrew's time as trade envoy.\n\"I have twice in the past asked to see the file on Andrew as trade envoy and, strangely, it is empty,\" he said.\n\"I met Andrew once as secretary of state, when I was invited to Buckingham Palace and he was asking me to find something useful for him to do. I didn't.\n\"Shortly after, in 2011, the first publicity appeared about his friend Epstein and I discontinued the envoy role,\" said Sir Vince.\nThe role of trade envoy is to promote the UK's business interests overseas and to encourage investment.\nSpeaking anonymously, a diplomatic source suggested that an envoy such as Andrew might legitimately have shared information with potential investors, encouraging them to support UK international business initiatives, which might have included in Afghanistan.\nAndrew's apparent note to Epstein says he is going to \"offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi)\".\nOn the wider principle of sharing documents, a former senior trade official said many of the reports seen by a trade envoy would have been quite \"pedestrian\", but sometimes the former Duke of York had \"really important meetings with really important people\" that produced real commercial opportunities.\n\"So it is always possible that there were significant commercial things in the documents which would have been useful,\" the former official said.\n\"They were absolutely not for sending outside government and particularly not to somebody who might seek to use them for commercial purposes. This was certainly not something a trade envoy could possibly do and justify in any way.\"\nThe former prince continues to be dogged by his links to Epstein after the latest tranche of documents released by the US government included pictures of Mountbatten-Windsor, fully clothed, kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground.\nHe is facing growing pressure to testify in the US about his links to Epstein and last week moved from his Windsor home to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.\nOn Monday a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

In at least 21 cases, Grok fully complied with the requests, generating images of women in revealing or translucent bikinis. The majority of those targeted were young women, and in some cases, men, celebrities, politicians, and even a monkey were subjected to these requests.\nSt. Clair described one horrific image that featured her in a bikini while turned around and bent over with her toddler’s backpack in the background.\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair said. “It’s another tool of harassment. Consent is the whole issue. People are saying, well, it’s just a bikini, it’s not explicit. But it is a sexual offense to non-consensually undress a child.”\nAccording to NBC News, the lawsuit further alleges that even though Grok confirmed that St. Clair’s “images will not be used or altered without explicit consent in any future generations or responses,” the AI still allowed users “to create more explicit AI-generated images of her and instead retaliated by demonetizing her X account.”\n“The creation and spread of nonconsensual sexualized images have sparked a worldwide response, including several government investigations and calls for smartphone app marketplaces to ban or restrict X. Regulators and other tech companies, though, have stopped short of restricting the app,” added the outlet.","wordCount":611},"cachedAt":1770816693182},"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-uk-is-mulling-an-australia-like-social-media-ban-for-users-under-16-130000446.html":{"data":{"author":"Contributing Reporter","date":"Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","siteName":"Engadget","imageUrl":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4zONcyfIfqGInrSYMwAjfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/f087f080-18c8-11ed-bfff-b85012b6c5a2","text":"The UK government has announced a consultation, asking people for their feedback on whether to introduce a social media ban for children under 16 years old. It would also explore how to enforce that limit, how to limit tech companies from being able to access children’s data and how to limit “infinite scrolling,” as well as access to addictive online tools. In addition to seeking feedback from parents and young people themselves, the country’s ministers are going to visit Australia to see the effects of the country’s social media ban for kids, according to Financial Times.\nAustralia's minimum age social media ban went into effect on December 10. It’s the first of its kind and covers several social media platforms, including Facebook, X, TikTok, Twitch, Snapchat, YouTube and Reddit. Just recently, Meta shut down nearly 550,00 accounts, most of which were on Instagram, to comply with the new law.\nThe UK passed the Online Safety Act in 2023 and has been enforcing its rules since. Last year, for instance, it started requiring websites that publish pornography to conduct age checks for users. But British politician Liz Kendall said parents still have serious concerns about the content their children can consume online. As The Guardian notes, the announcement for a consultation comes just before the House of Lords votes on an amendment to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. The amendment is seeking a social media ban on children under 16, which will be enacted within a year if and when the bill passes.","wordCount":253},"cachedAt":1770816695094},"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/iphone-18-pro-face-id-ltpo-plus-rumors/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816695963},"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/iphone-18-pro-sizes-under-screen-face-id-rumors/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816695965},"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/26/european-commission-opens-investigation-into-elon-musks-x-over-ai-deepfake-scandal/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816695965},"https://theshillongtimes.com/2026/02/06/heres-how-social-media-instagram-has-changed/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816695965},"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-bans-infofi-post-to-earn-crypto-apps-from-platform":{"data":{"date":"Thu, 15 Jan 2026 22:20:27 GMT","siteName":"Mashable","imageUrl":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03lnzC7uEnHjD9CtblhLpK3/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1768514055.jpg","text":"<button>\nThe Mashable 101 Creator Hub Tech Science Life Social Good Entertainment Deals Shopping Games\nSearch\n<button>Cancel","wordCount":17},"cachedAt":1770816697359},"https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-rolling-out-age-detection-system-to-keep-underage-users-off-the":{"data":{"date":"Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:43:59 GMT","siteName":"Mashable","imageUrl":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07ugUAa02GoM5ASbFWUANLE/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1768595298.jpg","text":"<button>\nThe Mashable 101 Creator Hub Tech Science Life Social Good Entertainment Deals Shopping Games\nSearch\n<button>Cancel","wordCount":17},"cachedAt":1770816697369},"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2026/01/14/elon-musks-grok-appears-to-modify-image-generation-after-outcry/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816699971},"https://coincentral.com/x-launches-starterpacks-feature-to-help-new-users-find-crypto-accounts/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816699971},"https://www.businessinsider.com/openclaw-moltbot-china-internet-alibaba-bytedance-tencent-rednote-ai-agent-2026-2":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816699972},"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/16/mother-elon-musks-child-sues-ai-company/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816699973},"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2026/01/16/grok-deepfakes-lawsuit/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816703976},"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/feb/9/congress-pressed-pass-legislation-grid-power-sources-without/":{"data":{"author":"Kerry Picket","date":"Mon, 09 Feb 2026 15:49:56 GMT","siteName":"Washington Times","imageUrl":"https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/12/18/Congress_Energy_Permitting_65398_c0-167-4000-2499_s885x516.jpg?f75d56569ea6be49104b9c47f28a530c5750ec68","text":"A coalition of right-of-center activists sent a letter Monday to the Senate urging passage of the DATA Act, which would allow off-grid power sources to be built and used without regulation as a public utility.\nLed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the group stressed the growing demand for electricity from AI data centers and others.\nThe DATA Act, Decentralized Access to Technology Alternatives, was introduced last month by Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican. It would allow data centers to bypass federal energy regulations to encourage the centers to build their own independent, off-grid power supplies.\nThis initiative is anticipated to support AI infrastructure development and establish “consumer-regulated electric utilities” or CREUs.\n“Electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers and other sources is rising at a rapid rate. At the same time, power plant retirements and renewable energy mandates in the states are pushing the grid to the brink,” the letter said. “The existing electrical grid will continue to struggle to meet this burgeoning demand unless we allow new options for electricity-intensive businesses to procure the power they need.”\nIt said off-grid power systems are one viable solution.\n“In addition to protecting customers, off-grid power systems would allow for the speed and innovation today’s grid sorely lacks. Therefore, the undersigned organizations want to express our strong support for Senate action to remove federal barriers for off-grid power systems, allowing them to more efficiently meet this sudden surge in power demand.”\nThe signatories include Advancing American Freedom, ALEC Action, Always On Energy Research, Americans for Prosperity, Cascade Policy Institute, The Foundation for American Innovation, Independent Women’s Voice, Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Pacific Legal Foundation, Pelican Institute for Public Policy, R Street Institute and Texans for Reasonable Solutions.\nPresident Trump is pushing the expansion of AI data centers as part of his efforts to build a U.S. advantage over China.\nNew ad campaign targets credit card price controls\nThe National Taxpayers Union launched a major advertising campaign warning voters about the effects of credit card price controls on affordability and access to credit for many consumers.\nThe campaign is expected to reach audiences through targeted digital advertising that highlights how government-mandated price controls would increase costs for consumers and harm the very families they are intended to help.\n“Price controls on credit will backfire onto the vast majority of cardholders with disastrous consequences,” said Brandon Arnold, executive vice president of National Taxpayers Union. “It’s no secret Americans feel the pressure of high costs. This is not the solution.”\nSenate lawmakers recently introduced the Credit Card Competition Act to put a 10% cap on credit card rates.\nThe taxpayers’ organization said that implementing these policies would cause “significant disruptions to the consumer credit market,” including leading card issuers to tighten underwriting standards, eliminate popular rewards programs, and introduce new or higher fees to offset lost revenue.\nDHS sued for hiding details of attack on ICE facility in Texas\nJudicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security to obtain video footage and photographs of the July attack on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas.\nThe lawsuit was filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia after ICE failed to respond to a July 10 FOIA request for surveillance video, body-worn camera footage and any photographs of the July 4 attack.\nA federal grand jury in Fort Worth, Texas, indicted nine people whom prosecutors called “North Texas Antifa Cell operatives,” and seven more were charged directly by prosecutors in the attack. The charges include rioting, using weapons and explosives, providing material support to terrorists, obstruction and attempted murder of an Alvarado police officer and unarmed correctional officers.\nInterior hit with accusations of political viewpoint purge\nLiberal legal group Democracy Forward filed suit against the U.S. Department of the Interior on Monday, seeking to compel the release of information about its September cancellation of some grants for nonprofit organizations as part of an “unlawful political viewpoint purge.”\nThe documents, Democracy Forward says, requested under the Freedom of Information Act, could reveal communications and guidance regarding the termination of these grants.\nThe organization noted that the grants’ terminations were announced around the same time a piece in The Daily Caller, a conservative outlet, covered the cancellations, given its focus on “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” Democracy Forward described the terminations as “retribution.”\nIn his first week in office, President Trump issued a series of executive orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the public and private sectors.\nThis included terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, posts and programs in the federal government, as well as DEI-related grants and contracts.\n• The Advocates column is a weekly look at the political action players who drive the debate and shape policy outcomes in Washington.

Nvidia is the world's largest producer of data center GPUs, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Navitas produces next-gen chips for AI-oriented data centers, but it also serves a wide range of non-AI markets.\nOver the past 12 months, Nvidia's stock rose nearly 30% as Navitas' stock rallied more than 165%. Could this smaller niche chipmaker continue to outperform Nvidia over the next year?\nThe differences between Nvidia and Navitas\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue by selling GPUs for gaming PCs. Today, it generates most of its revenue from the data center market. Most of the world's top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet's Google -- use its GPUs to power their AI applications.\nNvidia controls more than 90% of the entire discrete GPU market, and it locks in its data center customers with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), its proprietary programming platform for its own chips. The stickiness of that ecosystem should widen its moat against cheaper data center GPU makers like AMD ( ) and keep big tech companies tethered to it even as they develop their own first-party AI accelerator chips.\nNavitas produces gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) power chips that are faster, more power-efficient, and more temperature-resistant than traditional silicon chips. GaN chips are cheaper, faster, and operate at low-to-mid voltages -- which makes them ideal for phone chargers, laptop chargers, and data center servers. SiC chips are generally slower, more expensive, and operate at mid-to-high voltages, so they're often used in high-voltage EV powertrains, industrial systems, and data center power supplies.\nNavitas originally generated most of its revenue from its GaNFast Power ICs, which bundle together switching, sensing, control, and security features on a single integrated circuit. However, it expanded into the SiC market through its 2022 acquisition of GeneSiC, significantly increasing its exposure to the higher-growth EV and data center markets.\nLast year, Nvidia agreed to install Navitas' GaN and SiC chips into its own AI data centers to support its next-gen 800 V HVDC power architecture. That deal will significantly boost Navitas' exposure to the AI market, but it won't start mass producing those chips until 2027.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended last January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 47% and 45%, respectively. The secular expansion of the AI market should fuel that explosive growth.\nIt might face more competitors and messier trade restrictions over the next few years, but it should continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush for the foreseeable future. The rollout of its new Rubin platform, which merges a CPU and GPU on a 3nm chip, and the introduction of its next-gen Ferryman GPU architecture should reinforce that reputation.\nNavitas faces more near-term challenges as the macro headwinds drive its EV, solar, and industrial customers to right-size their inventories. As a result, analysts expect its revenue to decline by 45% in 2025 and 21% in 2026, before finally rising by 84% in 2027. However, that would still represent a negative three-year CAGR of 7% from 2024 -- and it's expected to stay unprofitable.\nNavitas' most significant catalyst for 2027 will be its power chip deal with Nvidia. If it successfully ramps up chip production for that partnership, its AI-oriented revenues will surge, reducing the importance of its macro-sensitive businesses. But if it struggles with delays or supply chain constraints, it could miss Wall Street's optimistic 2027 targets.\nWhich stock is a better value?\nNvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued at 25 times its projected EPS for fiscal 2027 (which mostly lines up with calendar 2026) and 13 times its projected sales. Navitas, which can't be valued by its earnings yet, looks a lot pricier at 63 times this year's sales.\nTherefore, it seems like Nvidia still has plenty of room to run as the AI market expands. Meanwhile, Navitas' valuation was likely inflated by the hype regarding its power chip deal with Nvidia -- as well as the long-term growth potential of the GaN and SiC markets. It could struggle to maintain that premium valuation if its core EV, solar, and industrial markets don't stabilize.\nBoth stocks could climb higher over the next decade, but Nvidia is clearly a better buy right now. It's bigger, it's growing faster, it has a wider moat, and its stock looks fundamentally cheaper.","wordCount":758},"cachedAt":1770816708441},"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/38049799/trump-diplomat-blasts-labour-free-speech-facial-recognition/":{"data":{"siteName":"thesun.co.uk","imageUrl":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon-e1459786005667.png?strip=all","text":"Attention,\nOur system has indicated that your user behaviour is potentially automated.\nNews Group Newspapers Limited does not permit the access, collection, text or data mining of any content from our Service by any automated means whether directly or through an intermediary service.

It works with all the top AI designers, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon. In fact, it recently opened its first U.S. plant to service these customers better. Nvidia made a big announcement when its first Blackwell architecture chips were the first to roll off TSMC's belts last year, and Taiwan Semi recently announced a huge deal with the Trump administration to invest $250 billion in U.S. plant development.\nThe company has been working on a U.S. expansion for years, even before recent tariffs became an issue. But part of the new deal includes lower tariffs for Taiwan-made goods, an extra plus for the company on merchandise not produced in the new U.S. locations.\nHigh-performance computing, the segment where the AI business operates, accounted for 58% of Taiwan Semi's total revenue in 2025, up 48% from 2024. Management said it would raise its capital expenditure spend this year, from $41 billion in 2025 to around $54 billion in 2026. \"At TSMC,\" said CFO Wendell Huang on the January earnings call, \"a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated to the high growth opportunities in the following years.\" That's an exciting sentiment for shareholders.\nA solid business\nBut what makes Taiwan Semiconductor stock a value as opposed to a risky growth stock is its long-established and diversified business. It's been around since 1987, and it has been at the forefront of semiconductor innovation since that time, well before AI was a buzzword.\nIt has spearheaded development of every kind of new technology since then, and it's still a major player in many different spaces, particularly smartphone and autonomous vehicles, which made up 29% and 5% of its business last year. That gives it staying power and value; if AI moves on to the next trend, Taiwan Semi will likely be spearheading that, too.\nConsidering all of its growth and opportunities, Taiwan Semiconductor stock is priced to buy.

This might seem puzzling, considering Nvidia's show of force in an emerging industry that is projected to total $13.6 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights.\nBut there are two reasons why Wall Street may be skeptical.\n1. Physical AI is right around the corner -- for real this time\nFor many years, driverless cars have been the technology that is about to go mainstream. In 2016, Tesla ( ) CEO Elon Musk predicted that a Tesla would drive itself from Los Angeles to New York City with no human needed by 2017. A decade after the prediction, while Tesla's AI-assisted driving technology is called Full Self-Driving (Supervised), it requires constant vigilance from human drivers.\nIn 2019, Alphabet ( )( ) joined Tesla in predicting that self-driving technology would grow exponentially by 2021. Yet while AI driver assistance is present in many vehicles, you can't buy a truly self-driving car today.\nTo be fair, there were many failed predictions about AI-related natural language processing software before the technology had a breakthrough moment in November 2022, with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The virtual assistant gained 100 million users in just two months. Chances are, you remember its immediate impact on markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had its best first half of a year since 1983, while Nvidia stock went on to surge over 1,300%.\nSo while the driverless car revolution has had some false starts, investors should not be dismissive of this trend. Unlike ChatGPT, which was instantly available for anyone with internet access to download and check out, most driverless car technology must be approved by regulators before consumers can experience it.\nThat might be a key reason why Huang's Alpamayo announcement hasn't attracted a fraction of the attention that ChatGPT initially received -- yet. But waiting too long, until the breakthrough attracts more buzz and headlines, could be an expensive mistake for investors.\n2. Nvidia has plenty of competition\nNvidia may well enjoy a first-mover advantage. But Jensen's ChatGPT analogy actually implies a possible dark lining for his company. After all, while Microsoft had a stake of more than $13 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Nvidia didn't, it was Nvidia that benefited far more from the AI revolution, with Microsoft shares not quite doubling since ChatGPT launched.\nStill, plenty of deep-pocketed tech giants are working feverishly to beat Nvidia to this projected $13.6 trillion market -- or at least deny it market dominance. Alphabet has committed $5 billion in funding to its subsidiary Waymo, the driverless car company that has already given 450,000 weekly paid rides, with 14 million trips in 2025. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley predicts that Tesla's prospects in the autonomous car market might actually be the biggest reason to invest in the $1.5 trillion company.\nA \"catch-all\" way to play this trend\nUltimately, I could see any one of these companies carving out a dominant market share in this multitrillion-dollar sector, or even another clear winner emerging. It's also possible that they more or less split the difference and benefit equally, in a $13.6 trillion market that has enough room for everyone.\nA simple way to profit no matter which company achieves dominance is through the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF ( ). The exchange-traded fund (ETF), designed to provide exposure to companies developing electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, is diversified, with a 4.19% position in Alphabet, its biggest holding, followed by a 3.53% position in Tesla, and a 2.66% position in Nvidia. Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Intel are the other big names in AI that are among its top 10 holdings.\nAs you can see, this fund's diversification allows investors to play the driverless car trend -- and, very likely, gain exposure to its eventual winner -- without putting all their eggs in one basket. It also contains many companies that have multiple paths to glory apart from the driverless car revolution. Tesla, for instance, is hoping to launch its Optimus robot in under two years, while Alphabet's large language model Gemini is already leading to partnerships with big names like Apple and Walmart.\nFinally, the ETF carries an expense ratio of 0.68%, which is reasonable considering its 10.73% average annual return since its 2018 inception.\nFor investors seeking a simple way to play this trend without pinning their hopes on any one tech firm, the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF is a buy.\nRead Next","wordCount":833},"cachedAt":1770816715882},"https://www.fool.com/coverage/stock-market-today/2026/01/13/stock-market-today-jan-13-amd-rallies-as-banking-stocks-struggle/":{"data":{"author":"Emma Newbery","date":"Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:07:00 GMT","siteName":"The Motley Fool","imageUrl":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.content.foolcdn.com%2Fimages%2F1umn9qeh%2Fproduction%2F23fc1b822f8eafa9d627ca7fbac8d5b39aebf467-1401x1251.png%3Fw%3D1401%26h%3D1251&w=3840&op=resize","text":"On Jan. 13, 2026, positive inflation data wasn't enough to bouy banking stocks today after mixed results from JPMorgan.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC +1.78%) slipped 0.19% to 6,963.74 today even as December CPI data came in slightly lower than expected.

That performance was driven mainly by the success and rising popularity among the investment community of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. These tech-centric businesses, and others betting big on artificial intelligence (AI) ventures, have powered an outsized share of the broader market's apparently ever-increasing value.\nInvestors and industry experts can be bullish on the longer-term prospects of AI. But it's important to see how matters stand in the present clearly. Here are three warning signs that the stock market today is in an AI bubble.\n1. Enormous capital outlays\nThe hyperscalers, a group of large data center operators that includes companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, spent hundreds of billions of dollars collectively on capital expenditures last year, mostly for AI-related projects. These massive sums are driving a surge in investment activity among these businesses compared to prior years.\nOpenAI, whose launch of the ChatGPT chatbot a few years ago set off this craze, might face a funding gap before this decade ends. The company says it plans to spend a jaw-dropping $1.4 trillion on computing resources over the next eight years. OpenAI reached $20 billion in annualized revenue last year, so where will the money come from?\n2. Unique financial engineering\nEven companies that generate robust net income and free cash flow are tapping the capital markets to raise money to fund all of this infrastructure spending. And there is no shortage of financial engineering going on.\nFor instance, a $27 billion joint venture between Meta Platforms and Blue Owl Capital allows the social media giant to keep that debt off its balance sheet.\nSo-called circular financing arrangements are also in place. These occur when one company purchases a stake in a target company that turns around and uses the capital it received to buy products and services from the original investor.\nIt's clear that there is a lot of interconnectedness between the various entities leading the AI sector. If one business starts to struggle in any capacity, the domino effect could lead to troubles across the space.\n3. Uncertain long-term returns\nIn November, OpenAI said that ChatGPT had 800 million weekly users. Alphabet's Gemini app had 650 million monthly active users in Q3. The rapidness of society's adoption of these AI tools has been impressive.\nBut research by Menlo Ventures suggests that only 3% of AI users pay for premium-tier access to those services. This calls into question whether the returns on all this AI capital spending will be adequate to justify it.\nThis leads me to another point: There's a chance AI will end up being only incrementally beneficial to the economy and society, providing less dramatic improvements than were delivered by previous innovations like PCs, mobile devices, and cloud computing.\nAs such, the people who are hoping that this technology will fundamentally change civilization or solve all the world's problems -- and who are bidding up the share prices of the companies involved accordingly -- might wind up disappointed.","wordCount":519},"cachedAt":1770816718354},"https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/people-profit/20260205-are-we-in-an-ai-bubble":{"data":{"author":"Kate MOODY","date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:55:41 GMT","siteName":"France24","imageUrl":"https://s.france24.com/media/display/b5f8c838-0288-11f1-972a-005056bfb2b6/w:1024/p:16x9/Untitled-Sequence-01-4.webp","text":"To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.\n1 min\nArtificial intelligence is the next frontier – but is it also the next bubble? That's the question investors have been asking since tech giants began investing billions of dollars in AI and driving stock market gains. We put the question to an expert.\nProfessor Jon Danielsson, Director of the Systemic Risk Centre at the London School of Economics, says he is \"fairly certain\" the market is at the top of an AI bubble, whose current levels of growth and investment cannot be sustained. \"The real question is if it's only stock market investors, then those investors will of course suffer significant losses (...) But the bigger threat to societies is if it's financed by borrowing money – which is increasingly the case – and especially if banks are providing the money. So what happens is if some of these investments sour, which I think is clearly likely, and if banks end up suffering significant losses, that itself can threaten the stability of the financial system.\"\nHe believes comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s are well-founded. \"Every technology bubble we have seen over the past 150 years is similar. We saw the telegraphs, electricity, the internet, telephones, railroads – they all meant that a large number of investors piled into this technology. The benefit to society was significant (...) but by far most of these investors lost everything, and only a handful ended up being winners. I see many parallels with the AI bubble today.\"\nWhen it comes to the technology itself, Danielsson says his biggest concern is \"how the private sector is rapidly rolling out AI and spending lots of money developing and using the technology, while the public sector is far behind. I've been following this space for a long time, and I've never seen as much difference between the capabilities of the public and private sectors.\"\nDanielsson admits: \"I use AI very extensively. I don't know how I did my work before AI happened!\" He says that despite some concerns, the technology is rapidly becoming inescapable. \"I suspect all of us will end up being very big users of AI going forward, and those who resist or don't want to use AI might find themselves on the wrong side of their careers, if not history.\"","wordCount":396},"cachedAt":1770816718851},"https://coincentral.com/deepsnitch-ai-dsnt-vs-world-liberty-financial-wlfi-deepsnitch-ais-utility-based-approach-and-100x-potential-leaves-other-affordable-coins-in-the-dust/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816719011},"https://coincentral.com/micron-mu-stock-soars-amid-global-memory-shortage-ai-chip-demand-us-taiwan-expansion/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816719011},"https://coincentral.com/nvidia-stock-dips-amid-export-ban-and-ai-investment-concerns/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770816723013},"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2026-02-11/tumbler-ridge-school-shooting-canada":{"data":{"author":"Jim Morris","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:33:00 GMT","siteName":"Los Angeles Times","imageUrl":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0ad2be6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/947x631+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fce%2F729b3140402ba9755788d32cf87c%2F1b43a2da28d94a6e931131d50f6b3342.jpg","text":"(Jordon Kosik / Associated Press)\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia — A shooting at a school in remote northern British Columbia left seven people dead, while two more were found dead at a nearby home, Canadian authorities said Tuesday. A woman believed by police to be the shooter was also found dead, apparently from a self-inflicted wound.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more than 25 people were wounded, including two who were airlifted to hospital with life-threatening injuries, after the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.\nSchool shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun control laws.\nThe town of Tumbler Ridge in the Canadian Rockies is more than 600 miles northeast of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta. The provincial government website lists Tumbler Ridge Secondary School as having 175 students from Grades 7 to 12.\nBritish Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters that police officers reached the school within two minutes.\nA video showed students walking out of the school with their hands raised as police vehicles surrounded the building and a helicopter circled overhead.\nPolice found six people dead, a statement said. A seventh person died while being transported to a hospital, and two more were found dead at a residence the authorities believe was connected to the attack. A suspect appeared to have died of a “self-inflicted injury.”\nRCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd told reporters that investigators had identified a female suspect but would not release a name, and that the shooter’s motive remained unclear. He added that police are still investigating the connection between the shooter and the victims.\nTumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka said the whole community is grieving.\n“I broke down,” he said, saying it was “devastating” to learn how many had died in the community of 2,700, which he called a “big family.”\n“I have lived here for 18 years,” Krakowka said. “I probably know every one of the victims.”\nThe Rev. George Rowe of the Tumbler Ridge Fellowship Baptist Church went to the recreation center where the victims’ families were awaiting more information.\n“It was not a pretty sight. Families are still waiting to hear if it’s their child that’s deceased and because of protocol and procedure, the investigating team is very careful in releasing names,” Rowe said. “The big thing tonight was my having to walk away and the families still waiting to find out. It is so difficult. Other pastors and counselors are there, so they are not alone.”\nRowe once taught at the high school and his three children graduated from there.\n“To walk through the corridors of that school will never be the same again,” he said.\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a social media post that he was devastated by the shooting.\n“I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he wrote.\nCarney’s office said he is suspending a planned trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia and Munich, Germany. He was set to announce a long-awaited defense industrial strategy in Halifax on Wednesday before heading to Europe for the Munich Security Conference.\nEby, the province’s premier, told reporters he had spoken to Carney after what he called the “unimaginable tragedy.”\n“I know it’s causing us all to hug our kids a little bit tighter tonight,” he said. “I’m asking the people of British Columbia to look after the people of Tumbler Ridge tonight.”\nCanada’s government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.\nTuesday’s shootings were Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.\nMorris and Gillies write for the Associated Press.

The report’s release, originally scheduled for Feb. 6 and delayed due to a short government shutdown, follows several other reports that have reignited concerns about a labor market still adapting to tariffs, an immigration crackdown limiting the supply of workers, and employers’ adoption of artificial intelligence.\nAhead of the report’s release, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Feb. 9 that people should expect “slightly smaller jobs numbers,” saying the results may reflect a “productivity boom” and “a pretty big decline in the labor force.”\n“One shouldn’t panic if you see a sequence of numbers that are lower than you’re used to because, again, population growth is going down, and productivity growth is skyrocketing,” Hassett said. “It’s an unusual set of circumstances.”\nHow is the job market overall?\nThe BLS reported there were 7.5 million unemployed workers and 6.5 million job openings in December, meaning there were nearly one million more potential job seekers than available positions. Unemployment benefit claims are up, and a Feb. 5 Challenger, Gray & Christmas report revealed employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January, the most for the first month of a year since 2009.\nIn 2025, economists described the labor market as a “low-hire, low-fire\" environment, as some American workers clung to their jobs in fear they would struggle to find new ones. That caution showed up unevenly across industries. Job seekers in healthcare, which proved to be an engine of steady job growth, may have been able to find work, while opportunities in other sectors were more limited.\nJeff Bonci, who serves as The Planet Group’s President of Accounting & Finance Staffing, said the hiring slowdown reflects a “timing and caution issue.”\n“Many companies paused hiring decisions late in Q4 and carried that conservatism into January as they waited on finalized budgets, interest rate clarity, and economic signals,” Bonci said in a statement to USA TODAY. “Looking ahead, we expect hiring activity to pick up as budgets unlock and companies move forward with targeted, skills-based hiring rather than large headcount expansions.”\nWill the Fed cut rates in March?\nConcerns about the job market prompted the Federal Reserve to cut rates three times late last year, but policymakers opted to hold rates steady at its most recent meeting Jan. 28.\nExplaining the decision, Chair Jerome Powell said while job gains have remained low, the unemployment rate had shown “some signs of stabilization” and the outlook for economic activity had improved. He added, however, that because labor force participation and demand had both softened, it was “a difficult time” to read the job market.\nTwo members of the rate-setting committee, Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, dissented from the January decision, preferring another quarter-point cut. Waller said he expected data revisions to reveal there was “virtually no growth” in payroll employment last year.\n\"Zero. Zip. Nada. Let this sink in for a moment—zero job growth versus an average of almost 2 million for the 10 years prior to 2025. This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market,” Waller said in a statement, adding that planned 2026 layoffs create a significant risk of “substantial deterioration” in the labor market this year.\nAs of Feb. 10, a majority of Fed watchers predict policymakers will continue to hold rates steady after their next meeting in March.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_","wordCount":624},"cachedAt":1770820386460},"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/faa-el-paso-airspace-closure-ended":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820388718},"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/11/2026-winter-olympics-drone-cameras-how-they-work/88621027007/":{"data":{"author":"Mark Giannotto","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:46:00 GMT","siteName":"USA Today","text":"The 2026 Winter Olympics have already delivered incredible feats of athleticism and the raw emotions that help this global sporting competition transcend sports and become part of the human condition. It's the new camera angles showing these Olympic moments, however, that might be the biggest innovation to come out of the first week of the Milano Cortina Games.\nDrone cameras have been used at the Olympics before, but new technology is allowing first-person view drones to bring viewers closer to the action than ever before, particularly in winter events like the luge, skiing and snowboarding. This new level of detail has also come with some concerns, though it appears the dynamic views produced thus far are worth the potential problems.\n\"We look at this as an evolution of the sport. The expectation today is to have this kind of experience when you consume a sports event, even more so for the Olympic Games,\" IOC sports director Pierre Ducrey told Reuters earlier this week. \"We strive to offer the best viewing experience whether in the stadium or outside.\"\nHere's more on the drone cameras that are all the rage at the 2026 Winter Olympics:\n2026 Winter Olympics drone cameras, explained\nDrone cameras have been used at the Olympics dating back at least a decade, but the development of first-person view drones has been deemed \"a game changer\" for the viewing experience by NBC officials, especially in speed sports.\nThese FPV drones can cover great distances and safely travel up to 75 mph while maintaining broadcast quality. They've also been used to provide aerial coverage as athletes move at high speeds. They weigh just 250 grams (or less than one pound), according to one Olympics drone operator featured in an NBC social media video.\nEach drone is operated by a three-person team – a pilot, a director and a technician – that manage the camera's flight path, according to The Washington Post. The drone can go close to an athlete, but not over them. Each drone has a broadcast camera and broadcast transmitter attached to it.\nWired reported the FPV cameras are typically controlled by goggle-style camera views with intuitive controllers, like a virtual reality headset rig. As a result, these are the first Olympic Games to offer 360-degree real-time replay.\n\"When a camera is chasing the athlete down the hill – right in front of them or right behind them – you truly get the sense of how fast they’re going,\" Michael Sheehan, the coordinating director for NBC’s Olympic coverage, told The Washington Post. \"That’s virtually impossible to capture with a wide shot shooting from the side. The drone coverage takes us to a place we’ve traditionally never been.\"\nWhy 2026 Winter Olympics drone cameras can be controversial\nThough the dynamic camera angles created by FPV drones is giving fans a view of the Winter Olympics they've never seen before, it does comes with some potential drawbacks.\nMost notably, the high-pitched whirring noise created by drones has been audible during broadcasts and it's ever-present for spectators attending outdoor events in which a drone camera is being utilized. It has led to social media complaints akin to the vuvuzela controversy at the 2010 World Cup.\nSome athletes have also expressed concerns about how close these drones get to them while competing. So far, however, this hasn't created major problems. The BBC reported one of the drones crash-landed in the first downhill skiing training session and left debris on the course.\n\"We tested drones before competitions, we have listened to the athletes' community ... so that the impact would not affect their performances, would not bother them in any way,\" Milano Cortina Olympics Sports Director Anna Riccardi told Reuters.\n\"Each athlete has a different level of sensitivity, awareness and capability for tackling innovation,\" she added. \"So far we have not received any complaints that might lead to the non-use of drones in the future.\"","wordCount":651},"cachedAt":1770820390126},"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2026/02/11/kennedy-center-washington-opera-split/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820393225},"https://fortune.com/2026/02/11/exclusive-marc-lore-and-melissa-bridgefords-wizard-emerges-from-stealth/":{"data":{"author":"Lily Mae Lazarus","date":"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","siteName":"Fortune","imageUrl":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Headshot-Enhancement-Request-Feb-5-2026.jpg?format=webp&w=1440&q=100","text":"Wizard, an AI-native shopping agent cofounded by Marc Lore and CEO Melissa Bridgeford, is coming out of a nearly 5-year private beta with an ambitious promise: to end the era of endless scrolling in ecommerce and replace it with a personalized and streamlined shopping experience.\nLaunched publicly on Feb. 11, the New York–based startup is betting that the next wave of online retail will be driven not by bigger marketplaces, but by agents that do the work of searching, comparing, and checking out on behalf of consumers.\n“The online shopping experience today is highly fragmented, and consumers are searching across multiple tabs, multiple websites, multiple social platforms to find and buy what they’re looking for,” Bridgeford told Fortune. “Wizard is simplifying that entire process by doing the work for you. We’re essentially generating the best product recommendations from across the web”\nThe platform’s launch has been a long time coming: Wizard raised a $50 million Series A in 2021 led by NEA, with participation from Accel and Lore, who also serves as cofounder and chairman. Lorex—best known for founding Jet.com and selling it to Walmart—where he later ran U.S. ecommerce, brings heavyweight credibility in online retail. Bridgeford, a Harvard Business School alum, previously founded Stylust, a conversational commerce startup that Wizard acquired and used as the foundation for its technology and team.​\nInitially, Wizard focused on a B2B conversational commerce model, helping brands and retailers convert shoppers via text-driven interactions. Over the past few years, as generative AI tools took off and consumer behavior shifted, the company quietly pivoted toward a consumer-first agent and ran a private beta to test engagement and conversion. Wizard declined comment on its recent finances.\nWizard’s model aims to cut through what Bridgeford calls an “all‑time high” in ecommerce friction, namely an abundance of options that carry measurable financial consequences for retailers. A 2024 Accenture survey found that 74% of the survey’s 19,000 respondents said that they had abandoned an online shopping cart at least once in the past three months because they felt “bombarded by content, overwhelmed by choice and frustrated by the amount of effort they need to put in to making decisions.”\nWizard’s answer, according to Bridgeford, is in-depth curation and end-to-end flow. Wizard searches across websites, customer reviews, and trusted editorial and social content to return a tightly curated set of products—often a top five—rather than thousands of results. To fully close the loop on transactions, Wizard also consolidated the search and checkout processes into a single process.\nThe public launch is combined with a partnership with Best Buy where the company is debuting its native checkout feature. The electronics giant represents one of the largest categories in e-commerce, generating $33 billion in revenue in the U.S. last year and demonstrating consistent year-over-year growth.\nWhile electronics is the first test case for Wizard, Bridgeford says the company has upcoming launches with retailers in other product categories including apparel (the largest e-commerce market in the U.S.), and beauty.\nOn the business side, the company’s initial business model includes a combination of take rates and affiliate revenue, but Wizard declined to comment further. However, Bridgford said that Wizard is setting itself apart from ad-driven marketplaces by not selling sponsored placements. Bridgeford argues that consumers have been “really drowned by sponsored product recommendations,” which she believes have crowded out organic results.\nLonger term, the company wants to build highly personalized “Wizards” for each user that knows their favorite brands, budget, and even details like their dog’s size.\nThat vision extends to the structure of online retail itself. Bridgeford talks about “a world without websites,” where consumers increasingly start—and finish—their shopping journeys inside agents like Wizard rather than on retailer homepages. Physical stores, she predicts, will lean further into experiential roles, while agents quietly handle the heavy lifting of search, validation, and checkout.\n“We’re still in the early innings,” Bridgeford says, “but AI shopping agents are going to eliminate that fragmented, frustrating experience and really transform how people shop online.”","wordCount":665},"cachedAt":1770820396687},"https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/02/10/trump-to-gut-environmental-regulations/":{"data":{"author":"Associated Press","date":"Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:30:04 GMT","siteName":"Boston Herald","imageUrl":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Trump-Air_Pollution_36733_996be1.jpg?w=1569","text":"By MATTHEW DALY, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday will revoke a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the White House announced.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. That Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\nPresident Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will “formalize the rescission of the 2009 Obama-era endangerment finding” at a White House ceremony, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\nThe action “will be the largest deregulatory action in American history, and it will save the American people $1.3 trillion in crushing regulations,” she said. The bulk of the savings will stem from reduced costs for new vehicles, with the EPA projecting average per vehicle savings of more than $2,400 for popular light-duty cars, SUVs and trucks, Leavitt said.\nThe endangerment finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change — deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.\nLegal challenges certain to come\nLegal challenges are certain for any action that effectively would repeal those regulations, with environmental groups describing the shift as the single biggest attack in U.S. history on federal efforts to address climate change.\n“The Trump administration is abandoning its core responsibility to keep us safe from extreme weather and accelerating climate change,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice. “There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year. Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court.”\nEPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said the Obama-era rule was “one of the most damaging decisions in modern history” and said EPA “is actively working to deliver a historic action for the American people.”\nTrump, who has called climate change a “hoax,” previously issued an executive order that directed EPA to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\nZeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying they were “willing to bankrupt the country” in an effort to combat climate change.\nDemocrats “created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence … segments of our economy,” Zeldin said in announcing the proposed rule last July. ”And it cost Americans a lot of money.”\nPeter Zalzal, a lawyer and associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, countered that the EPA will be encouraging more climate pollution, higher health insurance and fuel costs and thousands of avoidable premature deaths. The EPA is focusing solely on industry costs while ignoring the rule’s climate and health benefits, he and other advocates said.\nZeldin’s push “is cynical and deeply damaging, given the mountain of scientific evidence supporting the finding, the devastating climate harms Americans are experiencing right now and EPA’s clear obligation to protect Americans’ health and welfare,” Zalzal said.\nSupreme Court has upheld endangerment finding\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\nSince the high court’s decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nFollowing Zeldin’s proposal to repeal the rule, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reassessed the science underpinning the 2009 finding and concluded it was “accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.”\nMuch of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved, the NAS panel of scientists said in a September report. “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused greenhouse gases is beyond scientific dispute,” the panel said.\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the Environmental Protection Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/us-environmental-protection-agency\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.","wordCount":808},"cachedAt":1770820402445},"https://hoodline.com/2026/02/montgomery-county-council-tackles-spending-guidelines-workforce-development-and-climate-policy-amendments/":{"data":{"author":"David Abrams","date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:18:38 GMT","siteName":"Hoodline","imageUrl":"https://img.hoodline.com/2026/2/montgomery-county-council-tackles-spending-guidelines-workforce-development-and-climate-policy-amendments-5.webp?max-h=442&w=760&fit=crop&crop=faces,center","text":"Montgomery County Council's committee meetings are diving into matters of fiscal restraint, workforce development, and climate assessment amendments today. The Government Operations and Fiscal Policy Committee (GO), the Economic Development Committee (ECON), and the Transportation and Environment Committee (TE) are expected to tackle several pressing issues that could shape the county's economic and environmental landscape.\nOn the fiscal agenda, the GO Committee, chaired by Kate Stewart and including Councilmembers Shebra Evans and Sidney Katz, is reviewing a resolution to set the Spending Affordability Guidelines for the FY 2027 Operating Budget. With a deadline of February 10, as reported by the Montgomery County Council, these guidelines will establish ceilings on property tax revenues and budget allocations across various segments of the county's government and services.\nAdditionally, the Committee will assess Bill 28-24, which aims to transfer certain administrative powers over the Employees' Retirement System and other post-employment benefits to the Board of Investment Trustees. This potential shift in responsibility was indicated as an effort to refine the administration of retirement plans.\nThe ECON Committee, led by Chair and Council President Natali Fani-González, alongside Council Vice President Marilyn Balcombe and Councilmembers Evan Glass and Laurie-Anne Sayles, is evaluating a resolution to renew the designation of WorkSource Montgomery as the county's workforce development organization. The aim is to sustain the development of a skilled workforce, particularly focusing on strategic industries and creating pathways to sustainable wage jobs, per details shared by the council's press release. The committee meeting will also feature a briefing on Montgomery County's recent economic indicators, which include labor force dynamics and venture capital trends.\nOver in the realm of environmental policy, the TE Committee will discuss the nuances of Bill 34-25, which pertains to climate assessments within legislative processes. The proposed amendments aim at more accurately gauging 'community resilience' when introducing legislation or zoning text amendments. They will also receive a briefing related to household impacts pertaining to utility rates, with discussions on trends and available customer assistance programs for residents navigating the challenges posed by utility costs.","wordCount":339},"cachedAt":1770820403537},"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/4448175/mary-peltola-alaska-senate-climate-gop/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820403604},"https://www.thespec.com/life/trump-set-to-gut-u-s-climate-change-policy-and-environmental-regulations-white-house-official/article_29135d00-53d1-50d9-9f22-c3b23d6e94f1.html":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820403605},"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2026/02/10/trump-to-gut-environmental-regulations/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820403606},"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2026/02/11/climate-change/trump-climate-auto-rules/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820403606},"https://www.wired.com/story/winter-olympics-2026-impacts-snow/":{"data":{"author":"Marta Abbà","date":"Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:43:00 GMT","siteName":"Wired News","imageUrl":"https://media.wired.com/photos/697d551b34fb12a3d7ae48e1/master/w_2240,c_limit/013026_olympics_SnowMelt.jpg","text":"All told, the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are estimated to cause the loss of 5.5 square kilometers of snowpack and 34 million metric tons of glacial ice. Without the emissions caused by the event’s three main sponsors, those numbers would be much lower: 2.3 square kilometers of snowpack and about 14 million metric tons of glacial ice.\nThat’s according to a January report from the New Weather Institute, which worked with Scientists for Global Responsibility and Champions for Earth to determine the environmental impacts of the 2026 Winter Olympics and whether or not the staging of the Games was detrimental to the winter sports most impacted by climate change. What they found was that while the Games themselves caused considerable carbon emissions, the emissions caused by three of of the event’s main sponsors—Italian energy company Eni, automaker Stellantis, and ITA Airways—could possibly give the event a much larger carbon footprint.\nPromoting those corporations at the Games, the report’s authors argue, is estimated to bump up emissions “due to increased sales of high carbon goods and services” that those sponsors offer.\nThe report claims that Eni is responsible for more than half of total emissions brought about by the top three sponsors, followed by Stellantis and ITA. While acknowledging the difficulties involved in getting solid estimates on the companies’ carbon emissions and the size of the Olympic sponsorship deals, the report claims that the additional business those companies stood to gain from their involvement in the Games could cause 1.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. That’s 40 percent more than the Olympics’ direct footprint, which is estimated to be about 930,000 metric tons.\nThis means an additional loss of 3.2 square kilometers of snowpack and more than 20 million metric tons of glacial ice, adding to the 2.3 square kilometers of snow and 14 million metric tons of ice already impacted by the Games themselves. Put another way, this report claims that the Winter Olympics are contributing to a decline in the viability of the very sports they celebrate.\nIn response to the findings, an Eni representative told WIRED that the report provided a biased estimate of the company’s contribution to the emissions produced by the Games. The company also noted “more than 90 percent of the fuels supplied by Eni to power the Games are derived from renewable raw materials,” adding that its support of the Games is largely focused on the supply of energy products and services and doesn’t generate additional climate-altering activities.\nITA responded to a request for comment by noting that “sustainability is a cornerstone of ITA Airways’ development strategy” and pointed to its newer more fuel-efficient fleet and plans to use sustainable aviation fuels. The Milano Cortina 2026 Foundation, contacted directly about the Games’ environmental impact, declined to comment. Stellantis did not respond to requests for clarification on its sustainability initiatives related to the Olympics.\nWinter sports are becoming increasingly rare due to their vulnerability to the effects of global warming. The numbers testify to an emergency already underway. In the past five years, Italy, the Games’ host country, has lost 265 ski resorts. France, which will host the 2030 Winter Olympics, has seen more than 180 resorts in the Alps shutter. Fifty-plus ski lifts and cable cars have closed in Switzerland. With each iteration, the Games become increasingly dependent on artificially made snow.\nOut of the 93 locations with the infrastructure necessary to host the Winter Olympics, only 52 of them will be “climate-reliable” by the 2050s if global emissions continue at roughly their current rates, according to a 2024 study commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. By the 2080s, that number drops to 46.\nIn 2021, the IOC committed to cutting the Games’ direct and indirect emissions by 30 percent by 2024 and 50 percent by 2030. The organizing body claims that it hit its first goal in 2024, reducing emissions by more than 30 percent.\n“It is quite obvious to anyone who visits the real mountains that snow cover is being lost and glaciers are melting,” says Stuart Parkinson, the director of Scientists for Global Responsibility and lead author of the report. But he says he is convinced that “winter sports can be part of the solution by cleaning up their act and abandoning dirty sponsors.”\nWithout its high-emissions sponsors, the report found, the Milano Cortina Olympics’ total emissions would be 22 percent lower than those of the the PyeongChang Games in 2018. Minus the 2022 Beijing Winter Games—an outlier because Covid-19 zeroed out spectator travel—the 2026 edition would rank as one of the most sustainable editions in the recent history of the Winter Games. Organizers of this year’s Games were able to cut emissions considerably by reusing existing infrastructure. Only two new permanent venues were built, compared to six for PyeongChang and 14 for Sochi in 2014.\nEconomically, the report assures that eliminating carbon-intensive sponsorships and replacing them with low-carbon partners would save about 1.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent without impacting funding. Precise data are lacking, but Andrew Simms, codirector of the New Weather Institute, notes that “the Games are not sustainable if they have big climate polluters as sponsors.”\nThis story originally appeared in WIRED Italia.

That’s great news for consumers, because ultimately the market should decide the vehicles we buy, not Ottawa claiming some moral high ground. But while this is obviously a good move, let us not forget what came to those who opposed these Trudeau-era climate measures over the last decade.\nFor the better part of nine years we were told that the consumer carbon tax was not just good policy, but a moral imperative. To question a policy like the emissions cap at the time was questioning climate science itself. We were told that the electric vehicle mandate was civilization’s last hope. Anyone who dared to suggest that these policies were economically ruinous weren’t just wrong. They were immoral, and wanted the world to burn.\nEveryone remembers the lectures, from MPs like Mark Holland who equated opposition to these policies to climate denial, shameless selfishness, and a planetary negligence that bordered on being criminal. “What is the cost? It is to give up the future of the planet,” Mark Holland said at the modest suggestion that fuel taxes be paused for the summer to ease travel and vacation costs for Canadians.\nLiberal partisans were just as insufferable, throwing accusations of being in the pocket of “big oil” and sacrificing the future for our kids. But now, apparently things have changed. Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived and reversed, paused, or repealed all of it. Apparently the moral high ground taken to defend those policies wasn’t really that high after all.\nAnd the same Liberal MPs who spent nearly a decade questioning the morality, intelligence, and basic decency of those on the other side are now cheering. The cognitive dissonance here would be remarkable if it were not so pathetically predictable.\nSo what does all of this reveal? Well it reveals that it was always a sham. No, not global warming, that is very much real, but the policies, sanctimony and moral theatre were always about political posturing.\nAnd just for a moment consider the serious implications of these climate policies if the Liberals of less than a year ago were correct. If these climate policies were in fact essential for the survival of the planet, well our new Prime Minister is condemning us all to hellfire. If they really were non-negotiable moral necessities, well then their reversal represents us collectively turning our backs on the planet. But of course, they were always subject to the shifting winds of electoral polling and economic reality.\nWhat makes this truly outrageous is the treatment of those who saw this years ago. The people who rightfully warned that an EV mandate before infrastructure or consumer demand existed was madness. They were treated as moral fugitives. But now we’re just supposed to simply accept that the prime minister’s pragmatic reversals are wise governance? The same Liberal party that spent the better part of a decade painting its opponents as enemies of the future are now the party of sensible recalibration?","wordCount":503},"cachedAt":1770820406538},"https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2026/02/06/what-trumps-aspiration-to-conquer-greenland-means-for-canada/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820407609},"https://www.fastcompany.com/91488620/copenhagen-wants-to-cement-itself-as-a-sustainable-fashion-mecca":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820407612},"https://www.fastcompany.com/91483512/heat-pump-installations-high-electricity-prices":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820407612},"https://time.com/7373179/winter-olympics-2026-artificial-snow-climate-impact/":{"data":{"author":"Simmone Shah","date":"Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:45:16 GMT","siteName":"Time","imageUrl":"https://time.com/redesign/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.time.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F02%2Fwinter-olympics-milano-cortina-2026-artificial-snow.jpg%3Fquality%3D85%26w%3D1024&w=3840&q=75","text":"Just before the Winter Olympics kicked off, Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite town that will play host to a number of the Games’ alpine events, received a healthy dusting of fresh snow, easing earlier concerns about snow reliability after a warm start to the winter. But organizers have already produced over 56 million cubic feet of fake snow to create the conditions athletes expect.\nIt’s nothing new. Machine-made snow has been used by ski resorts for decades to combat unreliable weather conditions—for recreation and competitions alike. Around 60% of the world's ski resorts now rely on snowmaking machines alongside natural snowfall, and in 2022, the Beijing Winter Olympics relied on almost 100% artificial snow.\nAs climate change makes winters warmer, the practice could become more widespread—but it often comes with a climate cost.\nJust like natural snow, artificial snow is a mixture of snow and ice, but the process of creating it differs greatly from the snowflakes that form in the atmosphere.\n“Machine-made snow involves the freezing of liquid water into rounded beads of ice that, when collected together on the ground, take on an appearance of natural snow,” says Noah Molotch, snow hydrology professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\nMachines spray out a mixture of compressed air and water from a machine, a process that uses a lot of energy and water. A 2023 study found that, in Canada, producing 1.4 billion cubic feet of snow during an average winter requires an estimated 478,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity per year, resulting in 130,095 metric tons of associated carbon emissions—equivalent to the annual energy consumption of nearly 17,000 Canadian households—and an estimated 1.5 billion cubic feet of water—roughly 17,320 Olympic sized swimming pools.\nAdvertisement\nIt is estimated that the Games will need 84.8 million cubic feet of water—the equivalent of 380 Olympic swimming pools—for snowmaking alone, according to NPR. Where that water is sourced from is important, says Daniel Scott, professor of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo. “In many places in North America, and Cortina has them as well, we have purpose-built reservoirs in the mountain, where you capture spring runoff when there's plentiful water, put it up on the hill as snow, and 80-90% of that melts back down into the same watershed the next year.”\nThe same can be said for energy. “If you're using [electricity] from a grid that has a lot of fossil fuels in it, you're contributing back to climate change, which is the very reason you have to use snow making in the first place, so the source of electricity really matters,” says Scott.\nThe easy solution to the practice’s energy drain, Scott says, is making sure that electricity is coming from renewable sources—a switch that snow towns everywhere from Quebec to the French Alps have already made. The International Olympic Committee has said that “most” of the energy used for snowmaking this year will be renewably sourced.\nAdvertisement\nScott notes that, in some cases, the practice can change the ecological balance of a region, causing, for example, delayed blooms, though the impact is often minor. “When you add to the natural snow pack it takes longer to melt,” he says. “There is some compaction and impact on the vegetation and the soils on the ski areas.”\nArtificial snow though can help lower emissions overall, Scott says, by allowing people to ski closer to home.\n“If you took snowmaking away from New England, there would be no ski industry in the Northeast. Those who would want to ski from Boston or New York, would get on an airplane and fly to Colorado or Utah or drive up to Quebec,” he says. “Every one of those options has a massively larger carbon footprint.”\nBut artificial snow, no matter how sustainably it's produced, can’t solve the problems many snowy locales are facing as temperatures rise. A recent study found that, out of 93 potential host sites, only 52 would have reliable conditions for the Winter Olympics in the 2050s. Cortina d’Ampezzo now sees 41 fewer freezing days annually than when the Games were first held there in 1956. In order to produce machine-made snow, the atmospheric temperatures need to be relatively close to freezing temperatures.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s for this reason that the practice isn’t going to solve the issues that the Olympics and the winter sports industry more broadly will have to contend with in a warming world, says Molotch. “Artificial snow is not the silver bullet for addressing the issues related to climate change in the ski industry.”","wordCount":757},"cachedAt":1770820408692},"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/dont-let-donald-trump-distract-you-the-rest-of-the-world-is-finally-making-real/article_692ea75a-a10a-49a5-822e-920ec59c3d91.html":{"data":{"author":"Marco Chown Oved","date":"Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","siteName":"The Star","imageUrl":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/d0/bd041f42-057e-5351-ad37-580f1407bd5c/6973f8c09282e.image.jpg","text":"If you read climate news, 2025 was a bad year.

If those options are not available, consider an electric vehicle rideshare.\nLevi's Stadium itself was built with sustainability in mind, having opened in 2014.\nIn addition to ample public transit access, the host arena is equipped with solar-powered infrastructure, electric vehicle charging stations and water-saving upgrades that cut emissions and keep fans cool, according to the California Government Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation.\nSan Francisco International Airport is also playing a role in encouraging sustainability for the Super Bowl. It was one of the first U.S. airports to offer sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) -- a jet fuel made from waste cooking oil or other sustainable sources instead of fossil fuels, 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci said. 4AIR is a sustainability company that assists private aviation in implementing environmentally conscious programs.\n\"SAF allows aircraft to reduce carbon emissions without any required engine or fueling modifications,\" Ricci said in a statement sent to ABC News, adding that the Bay Area remains one of the top locations in which private jet customers are using sustainable fuels.\nSustainable fuel currently accounts for about 1% of all fuel sold at SFO, but the airport has a goal to hit 5%.\nThe NFL is also improving recycling efforts, both for fans and behind the scenes. An extra 200 recycling bins have been added around the stadium and surrounding campus, and \"sustainability staff\" have been deployed to assist fans, the NFL said. Additional sorting of waste bins will take place behind the scenes to minimize contamination and maximize recycling, according to the league.\nPepsiCo will provide reusable cups in an effort to reduce single-use plastic, continuing a pilot program the company launched with the San Francisco 49ers for the 2025 to 2026 season, the company said.\nFans can drop cups into special bins on the concourse so they can be collected, cleaned and reused, the company said.\n\"Every little bit helps, whether we're talking about carbon or plastics or transportation,\" Lincoln Bleveans, executive director of Stanford University's Department of Sustainability, Utilities and Infrastructure, told ABC News.\nAllowing fans to become familiar with options to live more sustainably -- especially on a stage as large as the Super Bowl -- is incredibly important for reducing individual carbon footprint and normalizing planet-friendly initiatives, Bleveans added.\n\"Seeing it in that sort of environment, perhaps experiencing it for the first time ... you are thinking about the way you're you're both buying food and disposing of waste,\" he said.\nPeople who will be watching from home also have the power to be a part of a more sustainable future, said Priscila Báez, associate director of events and outreach at Georgetown University's Earth Commons Institute -- a hub for environmental and sustainability innovation.\nThe most impactful thing people can do at home is reducing waste at the source -- more so than composting and recycling, Bleveans noted.\nTherefore, if you are planning on hosting a Super Bowl party at home, skip the plastic utensils and dinnerware, Báez told ABC News.\n\"It goes a really long way in terms of keeping plastic out of the environment and and out of the landfill,\" Bleveans said.\nKeeping an accurate count of your guest list is also imperative to reducing waste, Báez said. Food accounts for about 24% of all municipal solid waste sent to landfills, and it creates methane when it breaks down -- a dangerous greenhouse gas that is 25 to 28 times more potent for global warming than carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For any food that is not consumed, composting will be essential to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted from the breakdown, according to Báez.\nIn addition, making food at home will help to eliminate the wasteful packaging that takeout is wrapped in, Báez noted.\nBleveans also suggested incorporating more vegetables than meat-based dishes to further cut down on emissions from food.\n\"Bring the flavor, bring the texture, bring the the joy of the food, but find ways to make vegetables a larger part of that,\" he said, adding that he especially enjoys fried cauliflower topped with buffalo sauce.\nIn addition to reducing carbon footprint, this type of meal planning can also reduce cost and offer healthier alternatives, Bleveans said.\nAfter the game is over, the NFL will be donating materials and food to more than 30 local organizations, such as schools and banks. Last year's donations equated to more than $800,000 in food and materials, and the NFL expects to meet or exceed that figure this year as well, it said.\nThe NFL hopes to leave a lasting \"green legacy\" in the Bay Area through its new initiatives, it said.\n\"At the end of the day, it's a shared effort,\" Báez said.\nABC News' Dan Peck contributed to this report.\nSponsored Content by Taboola","wordCount":975},"cachedAt":1770820408936},"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/in-the-arctic-the-major-climate-threat-of-black-carbon-is-overshadowed-by-geopolitical-tensions/article_d01b745b-ef94-57eb-9d75-9e1d799ad094.html":{"data":{"author":"Peter Prengaman The Associated Press","date":"Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:11:16 GMT","siteName":"The Star","imageUrl":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/ce/6cee5618-fb25-558c-9315-b540f6c1b37a/69898974e1f86.image.jpg","text":"REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — As rising global temperatures speed up the melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, it’s set off a boom of ships taking routes that previously were frozen and not traversable.\nThe increase in marine Arctic traffic, which received increased attention as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for the United States to take over Greenland, has come with a heavy environmental cost: black carbon, or soot, that spews from ships and makes the ice melt even faster.

EPA, a 2007 decision that opened the door for the process by which the Obama administration finalized the original rule.\n“It’s not enough for the Trump administration to rescind the endangerment finding,” Milloy said.\nScalia's reductio ad absurdum: \"Frisbees and flatulence\"\nWhen the EPA failed to pursue regulations of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, Massachusetts along with 10 other states, cities and nonprofit organizations, petitioned the Supreme Court on the issue. In a 5-4 decision in 2007, the high court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gas emissions fit the Clean Air Act’s definition of an “air pollutant.”\nSo the EPA needed to determine if emissions endanger public health and welfare of the public, or if the science is too uncertain to make such a determination, the court concluded.\nIn his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that, by the majority’s reasoning, “everything airborne, from frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an ‘air pollutant.’” The ruling did not order the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It only set forth a reasoned basis for making a determination of whether or not the agency should do so.\nIn 2009, after former President Barack Obama was sworn in, officials at the EPA began working on an endangerment finding. Chris Horner, an environment and energy policy attorney, obtained emails from a Freedom of Information Act request that not only revealed that some officials were using aliases, they also showed that a finding of endangerment was pre-determined before a rule was proposed.\n“You are at the forefront of progressive national policy on one of the critical issues of our time. Do you realize that?” Georgetown law professor Lisa Heinzerling wrote then-EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson on Feb. 27, 2009. “You’re a good boss. I do realize that. I pinch myself all the time.”\nSince then, two Supreme Court decisions could impact the ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA. In 2022, the high court ruled in West Virginia v. EPA that Congress had not granted the EPA the authority to place emission caps on power plants as a means to regulate how Americans generate electricity, and in June 2024, the high court struck the “Chevron deference,” which allowed federal agencies broad latitude in interpreting laws when Congress hasn’t provided specific guidelines.\nNow is the time\nThese rulings, legal experts say, have created an opportunity to overturn Massachusetts v. EPA. Milloy explained that if the final rule rescinding the endangerment finding is going to stick through legal challenges, this has to happen.\n“If Massachusetts versus EPA is not reversed — and this is the time to do it — then this whole exercise is going to be an exercise for naught. Next time there’s a Democratic president, the Democrats will have the legal authority, so to speak, to reimpose the endangerment finding,” he explained.\nMilloy said he has “genuine concerns” that whoever is writing the final rule won't understand the importance of overturning that decision. “When this thing goes to court, it's going to require competent lawyering, which the Trump administration doesn't always have,” Milloy said.\nImproper administrative procedures\nGovernment Accountability & Oversight (GAO), a government-transparency advocacy group, argues that the final rule should include an accounting of how the Obama administration EPA had already determined that greenhouse gas emissions were dangerous to human health before they began preparing the conclusion.\n“EPA conducted a truncated and sham internal and inter-agency review process and similarly engineered a notice-and-comment public participation process effectively rendered meaningless, not genuinely open to rational consideration of arguments and evidence presented to the agency, and thereby not executed in a way that allowed it to have a meaningful impact on the final decision. The officials should have recused or been recused,” GAO argues.\nHorner told Just the News that if the repeal of the endangerment finding is going to hold, the EPA will need to throw everything at it, and that includes challenging the process he calls arbitrary and capricious that arrived at a finding of endangerment.\n“That it is the epitome of an all-pain-no-gain gesture of the sort that is impermissible under Michigan v. EPA. That Massachusetts v. EPA was wrongly decided and the Clean Air Act does not provide this authority, Justice Scalia was right. But it also should confess to the error of predetermination, because the evidence is strong that the required notice-and-comment rulemaking process was a sham, i.e., it had no chance of resulting in any other outcome than a finding of endangerment,” Horner said.\nImportant historically and politically\nMilloy agrees it’s an important point, but he said it won’t have much weight in court. The rule could have been challenged on this basis when the emails came to light, but it wasn’t. While the argument points to an egregious violation of administrative procedure, it won’t demonstrate the finding is wrong. That would make the argument moot, Milloy explained.\n“It's an important political point to make. It's an important historical point to make. It's a valid point. It's critical that everybody understands that. But it's not going to have an impact in court. What's going to be important in court is […] that EPA did not have authority to regulate greenhouse gasses given by Congress, and West Virginia v. EPA says that the EPA must have expressed authority for major regulatory programs. That should be case-closed,” Milloy said.\nHorner argued that courts may set aside agency decisions made with “unalterably closed minds,” which show a failure to consider other factors as a fatal flaw, just as they may if the agency relies on improper considerations.\n“After all, EPA is directly challenging the court to admit it made a mistake, in its 2007 opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA. EPA has the opportunity to do the same. And confessing error with new evidence is a tried-and-true means of burying rules brought about through unlawful means,” Horner said.\nNo endangerment found\nIt’s unlikely the Trump administration will try to dispute the science behind the endangerment finding in court. Though critics of the finding point out that, for all its conclusions that greenhouse gas emissions pose a risk, climate change hasn’t posed a serious danger.\nDr. Matt Wielicki, a geologist who writes about science, climate and energy on his “Irrational Fear” Substack, submitted comments on the proposed rule, arguing that treating carbon dioxide emissions as air pollutants produced costly regulations with no demonstrable climate benefit.\nWielicki argues, among other points, that carbon dioxide has a fertilizing effect that is greening the earth, climate-related mortality is at the lowest levels in recorded history, global sea level rises are moderate, and there are no clear trends in extreme weather. He also points out that the 2009 finding has had no benefits in terms of global emissions, which have continued to rise ever since, largely driven by rising emissions in India and China.\nThe final rule is expected this week, which will be the first chance for experts to see what it contains. That will signal the start of what is likely to be a years-long litigation effort and ongoing debate on climate issues.\nLearn more","wordCount":1314},"cachedAt":1770820414920},"https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2026/02/09/in-the-arctic-the-major-climate-threat-of-black-carbon-is-overshadowed-by-geopolitical-tensions/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820415620},"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/4/musk-labels-spain-pm-tyrant-after-madrid-proposes-social-media-curbs":{"data":{"date":"Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:00:00 GMT","siteName":"Al Jazeera","imageUrl":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6982ea90a3aab-1770187408.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80","text":"Tech billionaire and owner of X, Elon Musk, has dubbed socialist Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez a “tyrant and traitor to the people” of Spain for introducing new social media curbs for children under the age of 16.\nMusk’s comments on Tuesday came in response to an announcement by the Spanish prime minister that Madrid would introduce new changes to the country’s social media laws.\nThe proposed measures include a ban on social media for children under 16 and a new legal framework to hold tech executives criminally liable for illegal content.

That situation seems likely to continue – the Government says that its promised abolition of the triple lock will not affect Irish neutrality; the Opposition insists that the move would represent the “final nail in the coffin” on this issue.\nREAD MORE\nLong-time watchers of Irish politics are entitled to view this debate as ironic. When the triple lock was touted as a guarantee that neutrality would not be affected by the Nice Treaty, it was Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who argued that the triple lock ensured Irish neutrality.\nNow they are arguing that its removal does not affect neutrality. Many of those who argued then that the triple lock did not safeguard neutrality now say its removal would be the end of neutrality. Take your pick.\nEither way, the addition of a guarantee of neutrality to the Constitution enjoys wide support, with majorities in favour among supporters of all the big parties.\nBut the question of the triple lock is more divisive. While a majority of those who express a view (45 per cent) wish to keep the triple lock in place, a substantial minority (35 per cent) want to get rid of it, while 21 per cent say they don’t know.\nFianna Fáil supporters are more or less evenly split on the question (40-39 in favour of keeping it), Fine Gael voters want to get rid of it and Sinn Féin supporters are strongly in favour of keeping it, by a margin of two to one.\nThe Government has said it would bring forward the legislation later this year.\nAt the same time, however, voters strongly believe that the Republic should take more responsibility for our defence, with 85 per cent of respondents agreeing and just 8 per cent disagreeing. There is strong support across all demographics and among supporters of all parties.\nViews on relations with Trump differ on whether the “fixture” is at home or away. Voters are narrowly in favour of Taoiseach Micheál Martin going to the White House for St Patrick’s Day – 48 per cent in favour, 45 per cent against – but don’t want the US president in Ireland.\nBy almost a two-to-one margin, voters don’t want him invited to Doonbeg, Co Clare, for the Irish Open this year. Depending on how you choose to interpret this, it displays a subtle diplomatic sensitivity or is simple hypocrisy. Or maybe those two things are the same.\nVoters are unambiguously hardline on social media companies, though. Three-quarters favour banning under-16s from social media and 90 per cent say social media platforms that have broken the law by circulating illegal images should be banned.\nIt’s a topic with which the Government – mindful of the importance of US tech companies to the State’s economy and of the close ties the industry has to the Trump administration – is wrestling. But the public has certainly made up its mind.","wordCount":600},"cachedAt":1770820420165},"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y33xjmm3mo":{"data":{"author":"Katy Watson","date":"Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:00:03 GMT","siteName":"BBC","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cb1a/live/c8c335c0-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp","text":"Social media platforms do not want Australia's landmark social media ban to be successful in case it incentivises other countries to follow suit, the nation's internet regulator has told the BBC.\n\"These companies have come to this regime, if you will, kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly,\" eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\nAustralia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December, a policy being closely watched by other world governments.\nThe UK is considering similar legislation; this week, the House of Lords voted to support a ban for under-16s via an amendment to the government's schools bill.\nAustralia's ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.\nCompanies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but do not think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.\nIn an update earlier this month, the Australian government said 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children had already been shut down, declaring the policy a huge success.\nInman Grant told the BBC children had proved to be an \"incredibly lucrative\" market for social media platforms, noting the addictive properties of platforms that were initially designed for adults.\n\"They're building a pipeline for the future, and they do not want this to be the first domino,\" she said, adding that they do not have a \"huge incentive\" to \"perfectly\" comply with the ban.\n\"We've always had to play a bit of a dance with the tech companies, clearly they don't like to be regulated.\"\nWith the legislation coming into effect just over a month ago, Inman Grant said researchers were still carefully monitoring the resulting shifts in behaviour among young people.\nOne criticism had been that under-16s would simply migrate to other platforms following the ban, but Inman Grant said the data indicated otherwise. While there was an initial spike in downloads of other social media applications, she claimed there has been no sustained uptick in their usage.\nAnother concern had been that children would circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that is performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.\nUnder the law, firms face fines of up to A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms, and Inman Grant said a second series of concerns notices is about to be sent to companies, naming the platform Snapchat as a key focus.\n\"We're starting to see some anomalies and weaknesses and I will probe those,\" she said.\n\"There are some kids that are getting through Snapchat, which is one that has been a primary focus for now,\" she said, adding that she needed to probe whether the platform had implemented its settings in the right way.\n\"[The policy] is certainly exceeding our expectations, but we are playing the long game here,\" she said, adding that regulators will always have to take a dynamic approach to the safety of young people online.\nInman Grant also told the BBC that Australia was working with \"like-minded\" countries such as the UK to take a stand against platforms where \"terrorist violent content is openly available to young children\".\nShe gave the example of Southport killer Axel Rudakubana who was found to have accessed graphic footage of the stabbing of Australian bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel on X, before leaving home to carry out the attack.\n\"When terrorist violent content is so openly available to young children it normalises, it desensitises and it sometimes radicalises - at some point you have to take a stand.\"\nAustralia is not the first country to experiment with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, it is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.\nTen platforms are currently included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\nIt currently does not include dating websites, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord, or AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\nSocial media platforms have regularly pushed back on the legislation, with Meta arguing that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\nThough Reddit has complied with the ban, it has also launched a challenge in Australia's highest court, where it will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights.\nAustralia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\n\"We will not be intimidated by big tech.

and also point out that such amendments cannot benefit a sitting president.\nMnangagwa, who first came to power in 2017 after a military coup ousted long-time leader Robert Mugabe, won a presidential election the next year and a second term in 2023 - though the results were disputed.\nKnown as \"the crocodile\" because of his political cunning, his final five-year term is due to expire in 2028.\nIn a referendum held 13 years ago, Zimbabweans overwhelmingly voted for a new constitution that introduced presidential term limits when Mugabe's grip on power seemed entrenched - he had ruled the country since independence in 1980.\nHints that Mnangagwa, who was once Mugabe's deputy until they fell out over the growing political ambitions of the then-first lady, wanted to stay in power beyond 2028 started two years ago.\nThe slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be chanted at Zanu-PF rallies with his supporters saying he needed to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme - though President Mnangagwa publicly rejected the idea.\nHe has faced some fierce detractors within Zanu-PF, but his main critic - Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\" - died last week.\nThis time last year Geza, a respected veteran of the 1970s war of independence and then member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee, had launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa's ambition to stay in power.\nHe apologised for helping him come into office and accused the president of nepotism in his bid to stay in office beyond 2028.\nZanu-PF expelled Geza from the party for disloyalty and he was forced into hiding.\nYet he continued to attract a large following on social media, where he regularly posted videos calling for protests.\nHours before his death a message posted on his social media pages urged Zimbabweans to carry forward the \"noble war\" to remove President Mnangagwa and \"end the plunder of our country\".\nHe was in South Africa when his family announced his death on Friday.\n\"At a time when silence would have been easier, he chose to speak out against corruption and nepotism that continue to undermine the promise of independence,\" Andrease Ethan Mathibela, national chairman of the influential Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, said.\nThe government is now forging forward with its 2030 plans for Mnangagwa and says the intention behind the draft law is to strengthen governance and bring political stability.\nYou may also be interested in:","wordCount":516},"cachedAt":1770820426388},"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5728356-pelosi-to-endorse-jack-schlossberg/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820426726},"https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-trump-aides-whisper-about-crazed-racist-post-wolff/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820426727},"https://www.businessinsider.com/massive-russian-losses-ukraine-pushing-it-to-breaking-point-nato-2026-1":{"data":{"author":"Jake Epstein","date":"Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:11:00 GMT","siteName":"Business Insider","imageUrl":"https://i.insider.com/696779b5764ca5f34d2a6828?width=2000&format=jpeg&auto=webp","text":"NATO's secretary general said up to 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed in Ukraine each month.\nMark Rutte described the carnage as \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\nThat suggests that a breaking point is coming, though it remains unclear when.\nRussia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\n\"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\n\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years.\n\"Now they lose this amount or more in one month,\" he said of the number of Russian soldiers killed every month. \"So that's also unsustainable on their side.\"\nRussia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month.\nRussia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\"\nRussian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media.\nThe casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political cost.\nRussian military efforts to bring fresh troops into its war against Ukraine include offering financial benefits to some informal recruiters, sourcing combat personnel from overseas, and playing with the legislation on the use of active and inactive reserves, among some other unofficial methods, Stepanenko said.\n\"Before, the Kremlin just assigned your military recruitment centers, some paramilitary organizations, and regional authorities to do recruitment,\" she said. Now, Moscow has to think: \"Where else can we squeeze recruits from?\"\nUS and Ukrainian assessments from last year suggested that Russia was pulling an average of 30,000 to 36,000 new soldiers a month into the war, figures similar to its casualty rate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said thousands more than that are volunteering.\n\"It is certainly a challenge for Russian forces to replace personnel and replace the casualties,\" Stepanenko said, adding that Russia will eventually \"hit a wall\" if it doesn't change its personnel and recruitment system eventually.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which does not disclose official casualty figures similar to Russia, is believed to have suffered an estimated 400,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Those losses hit hard, as Ukraine faces a constant struggle for manpower.\nThe proliferation of drones over the battlefield has made it increasingly difficult to evacuate casualties from a widening kill zone that extends in both directions along the front line, significantly contributing to the heavy losses.\nUkrainian and Western soldiers and officers have said that \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies — is long gone in this war.","wordCount":737},"cachedAt":1770820427568},"https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-minnesota-cities-church-nekima-levy-armstrong-11404085":{"data":{"author":"Peter Aitken","date":"Fri, 23 Jan 2026 02:39:00 GMT","siteName":"MSNBC Newsweek","imageUrl":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arrest-split.png?w=1600&quality=80&webp=1","text":"The White House seemingly confirmed on Thursday that its official account on X had used a digitally altered image of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a woman arrested in Minnesota for her role in a demonstration at the Cities Church in St. Paul over the weekend.\nNewsweek reached out to the White House via email on Thursday evening for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe White House and Trump administration officials have regularly posted artificial intelligence-generated images and video to their social media accounts, such as the video of President Donald Trump dropping brown sludge on \"No Kings\" protesters while piloting a fighter jet.\nThis occurs as critics continue to raise the alarm over altered images and video due to concerns that such media can be used to skew public perception and understanding of sensitive topics.\nAnd tensions in Minnesota remain high following the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on January 7. Armstrong was part of a demonstration in which dozens of protesters entered the Cities Church during a service on Sunday, where David Easterwood serves as pastor. He purportedly also leads an ICE field office in St. Paul.\nWhat To Know\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem at 10:21 a.m. ET Thursday posted a photo of Armstrong's arrest, which showed her with a calm look on her face as she's escorted by a law enforcement officer, whose face is blurred out.\nNoem wrote that Armstrong played a \"key role in orchestrating the Church Riots\" in St. Paul, adding that \"religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States - there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion.\"\nBut roughly 30 minutes later, the White House posted a photo of Armstrong—with seemingly the same officer, background and other details, but with Armstrong now crying and distressed. The latter image, which X community notes labeled \"digitally altered,\" was reposted by Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance.\nWhen asked for comment, outlets such as CBS News and The Guardian reported that the White House redirected them to a post by White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelon Dorr, who had also reposted the image and wrote: \"YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue.

She is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241. Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States - there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion.\"\nArmstrong, speaking Tuesday: “You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities. When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice—it is intimidation.”\nIn a polarized era, the center is dismissed as bland.

But should it?\nLast week, the Globe and Mail and Politico reported that Ottawa was considering a ban as one of multiple ways to better protect young people from online harms such as cyberbullying, addiction, the posting of CSAM, or child sexual abuse material, and worsening mental health.\nCanada’s privacy commissioner requires platforms to get parental consent before they collect personal information from children under age 13. That has led to most apps to require that users sign up with a birthdate showing they are at least 14 years old if they want to do anything beyond just viewing content. However, an outright ban could, in theory, enforce that rule, and require platforms to prove that they aren’t allowing children to access their content.\nBetaKit managing editor Sarah Rieger chatted with Josh Tabish, senior director for Canada with tech policy advocacy group Chamber of Progress, about why he thinks a ban isn’t the right move—and what could be done instead.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nAustralia recently banned children under age 16 from making social media accounts; the UK has voted to do the same. Denmark, Norway, France, and Spain are considering similar proposals. Why shouldn’t Canada?\nThe first thing I’d say is these lawmakers are responding to real concerns. I’m a parent, and I think parents are desperate for help. My concern is that while social media bans play well politically, I’m not sure they make for good policy.\nIt may have a lot of symbolic value, but it may not have a lot of technical teeth because kids are smart.What kids really want and need are online spaces that are safe for them: spaces that have age-appropriate designs, places where they can learn and express themselves and connect with each other. This is particularly true for at-risk, marginalized kids: anyone who is a little different. Internet access can be a real lifeline.\nWhat I worry about is if you implement a social media ban, what are [companies’] incentives to invest in safety features? If kids aren’t on the platform, that means less development cycles. That means less content moderation. That means fewer trust and safety people to help make the spaces better.\nAustralia is the first mover here—it will be interesting to see the impact on kids’ digital literacy. Are they learning to stay safe? Does it let social media platforms off the hook?\nI’ve seen some reports that suggest kids are finding workarounds. Teenagers are very good at getting around rules. They’re using VPNs (virtual private networks), they’re creating fake accounts, they’re using shared family devices. They’re also flocking to social media platforms that aren’t captured by the regulations. [Editor’s note: Australia’s ban does not capture platforms with social features like YouTube, Roblox, or Lemon8.]\nYeah.\nThis is a really important point. When you see a ban being considered, the first question is: how is this going to work?\nPlatforms have some options available to them. In Australia, the law says platforms have to figure out a method for determining age. They can estimate based on data [Editor’s note: Roblox, for example, is using AI to scan children’s faces]. They can ask for ID verification. The big drawback with this is that no matter how you tailor the rules, you are encouraging platforms to collect data on kids and store it. And if you read the news, you know that companies are routinely the subject of data breaches.\nThe government’s plans are still a little unclear. They have been feeling, I think, a lot of pressure to act since their previous online harms bill stalled out. Culture minister Marc Miller has said that he plans to bring measures forward. So we don’t really know what that means.\nWe’ve seen in Bill C-16 a measure to make the distribution of non-consensual deepfake images illegal. That’s a good step in the right direction. But what’s next is the million-dollar question. We don’t think social media bans are the right approach. But they would need to be paired with other measures as well, like digital literacy training or other incentives to encourage platforms to create safer spaces.\nCanada is a bit of an outlier in that it’s one of the few G7 countries that doesn’t have a national digital literacy strategy. If you look at countries considering social media bans, like the UK or France, they also have strong strategies to help make sure kids know how to stay safe online.\nIt seems odd to implement a ban before measures on how to educate; awareness usually comes before hard regulations. Say a ban is effective: then you get this generation of kids that have a limited experience of social media when they turn 14, or 16. Training for parents is super helpful too. Tech is a hard space to stay on top of.\nWe are seeing some good efforts from platforms. To pick one, Apple has a new kids’ account feature that by default will add safety settings that will block adult content. YouTube just rolled out a feature for parental controls that will not allow kids to endlessly scroll short videos. I wish someone would turn that feature on for me.\nWhere we see good approaches are countries incentivizing platforms to make spaces safer in ways that make sense for their business model.\nAt times it can feel like everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else. It’s like the Spider-Man meme.\nPhilosophically, I think everyone can agree that companies should bear some responsibility for the stuff they put out into the world. The problem is porn companies say it should be managed, Meta says the issue should be solved by the app stores… all these approaches are flawed in the same way, which is they let the person pointing the finger off the hook.\nI think the right approach is to create incentives for platforms to act responsibly; at the end of the day, the responsibility is on developers to make their spaces safe and to enrich the experience for everyone.\nThe latest platforms that have been raising alarm bells are AI chatbots. Are there any special considerations when it comes to creating regulation to make those tools safer for youth?\nI think it’s actually really easy to over index on risk and imagine every bad thing that can happen with AI. I think chatbots will be super helpful for kids in a variety of ways, like as an educational resource.\nChatbots are probably here to stay for the foreseeable future; teaching kids how to interact with them in safe and reasonable ways is something we should turn our attention to.\nThe Canadian government has a voluntary code of conduct for AI developers where they ask companies that have signed on to mitigate risks. If you asked me to gaze into a crystal ball, I would assume that voluntary code will form the baseline for future AI safety regulations.\nWe’re talking a lot about Canada’s role in governance here, but a lot of these platforms are giant US tech companies. Is it even possible for us to govern Meta, or X?\nWell, X is a special case.\nBut, broadly, I think Canada should do what’s right for Canadians. I think policymakers shouldn’t be afraid to pass laws to protect Canadians online. Canada’s sovereignty isn’t up for debate. Laws like the Online News Act remain on the books.\nThe government faces a tricky balancing act: they need to find policies that protect Canadians and help us grow our tech economy but also don’t jeopardize our relationships. I think they can do that, I just think it’s going to require a lot of careful consideration and creativity.\nIf you want to learn more about accessing social media spaces safely and responsibly, Tabish recommends checking out MediaSmarts, Canada’s national digital literacy organization, or digital rights group OpenMedia.","wordCount":1338},"cachedAt":1770820427594},"https://hoodline.com/2026/01/cambridge-advances-math-is-a-civil-right-campaign-in-honor-of-bob-moses-legacy/":{"data":{"author":"Benjamin Cortez","date":"Fri, 16 Jan 2026 20:32:32 GMT","siteName":"Hoodline","imageUrl":"https://img.hoodline.com/2026/1/cambridge-advances-math-is-a-civil-right-campaign-in-honor-of-bob-moses-legacy_(2)-2.webp?max-h=442&w=760&fit=crop&crop=faces,center","text":"Boston\nIn the ongoing pursuit to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the city of Cambridge is focusing attention on another civil rights champion, Bob Moses, who ardently believed that math education is essential for societal participation and empowerment. According to a recent announcement from the city's STEAM Initiative, this year will see continued efforts to push the mantra 'Math is a Civil Right'. Moses, a former Cambridge resident and an educator, dedicated his life to working through The Algebra Project to bridge the substantial equity gaps in math education for those often marginalized in society.\nThe math initiative, formed in partnership with the Cambridge Public Schools Math Department and The Young People’s Project, has already manifested in community action such as the Bob Moses Math Trail, support for out-of-school math programs, and engaging events like the Counted Out documentary screenings. These collective efforts are part of a broader coalition including Tutoring Plus and Cambridge Math Circle, among others, that has been actively working to create a fairer math ecosystem within the city's educational framework. The goal is clear: To ensure that students from all backgrounds receive the tools they need to unlock opportunities across all fields, but particularly those in STEAM.\nAs the initiative evolves, the STEAM collaboration pushes forward on several fronts. One such endeavor is the OST Math Equity Lab, where six professional learning sessions will aim to enhance out-of-school time (OST) educators' strategies for fostering a positive math mindset. Another key venture is the Counted Out Storytelling Project, which will give Cambridge teens a platform to express their math learning experiences through multimedia. By sharing these narratives, the initiative believes students will not only empower themselves but also propel change in how math is taught and learned in schools.\nThe STEAM initiative also has plans to deepen its engagement with families and the entire community. Among its approaches is an 'Everyday Math' social media campaign designed to spark regular mathematical conversation with early learners, and a partnership with the Cambridge Public Library for the distribution of Early Childhood Math STEAM Kits. Additionally, there's anticipation for the Citywide Math Playground and National Flagway Tournament, an event set to roll out in spring along with YPP, intended to bring mathematics to life for students and their families. These initiatives collectively aim to scaffold an inclusive environment where every student feels fully equipped to grapple with the numerate demands of the world.\nTo delve deeper into the ambitious 'Math is a Civil Rights Movement' and to get involved, interested parties are encouraged to visit the STEAM Initiative's official webpage. The city of Cambridge and its assorted partners remain steadfast in their conviction that mathematics is not just a subject taught in school, but a fundamental tool for combatting inequality, and thus a cornerstone for civil rights as envisioned by leaders like Moses and King.","wordCount":478},"cachedAt":1770820430407},"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/07/politics/todd-blanche-ed-martin-schism-broader-maga-divide-administration":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820430734},"https://hoodline.com/2026/01/st-george-police-emphasize-the-importance-of-car-insurance-in-traffic-thursday-social-media-campaign/":{"data":{"author":"Piper Shaw","date":"Thu, 15 Jan 2026 22:21:53 GMT","siteName":"Hoodline","imageUrl":"https://img.hoodline.com/2026/1/st-george-police-emphasize-the-importance-of-car-insurance-in-traffic-thursday-social-media-campaign.webp?max-h=442&w=760&fit=crop&crop=faces,center","text":"Salt Lake City\nIf you're cruising in St. George, Utah, remember that your car needs more than just a tank of gas and love to be road-legal.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) are introducing a bill that touches on one of the hottest Hollywood-tech debates in the development of AI: The use of copyrighted works in training models.\nThe Copyright Labeling and Ethical AI Reporting Act would require companies file a notice with the Register of Copyrights that detail the copyrighted works used to train datasets for an AI model. The notice would have to be filed before a new model is publicly released, and would apply retroactively to models already available to consumers.\nThe Copyright Office also would be required to establish a public database of the notices filed. There also would be civil penalties for failure to disclose the works used.\nAmong the groups endorsing the legislation are SAG-AFTRA, the Writers Guild of America west and east, the Directors Guild of America, IATSE, the American Federation of Musicians, the Authors Guild, the National Association of Voice Actors, the National Music Publishers Association, the Artists Rights Alliance, SoundExchange and the Television Academy, per Schiff and Curtis.\nThe Recording Industry Association of America is backing the bill but, noticeably, the Motion Picture Association is not on the list. There’s been some disagreement among studios on how to respond to the emergence of AI, and the industry position has been that existing copyright law can address issued raised over the use of protected works.\nThe bill stops short of requiring AI companies license copyrighted works for use in training models, something that is the subject of multiple lawsuits brought by authors and creators. That question also is touched upon in litigation brought by Warner Bros., The Walt Disney Co. and NBC Universal against Midjourney.\nAI companies have argued that their use of copyrighted works is a fair use, while President Donald Trump has said that a licensing requirement would be impractical.\nIn a statement, Schiff said, “While AI has the potential to improve our lives and change the way we work and innovate, we need a unified approach to implementing guardrails that protect the work and livelihoods of all workers, including artists and creators.

Through an initiative called Empire AI, a partnership is being formed across SUNY campuses to expand AI research and education, with a focus on public-interest applications.\nIn a news release from the Governor’s Office, it was stated that SUNY’s four university centers will partner with several other SUNY schools, supported by the Empire AI supercomputer based at SUNY Buffalo. The initiative will provide students with new research opportunities and access to microcredential courses, with an emphasis on responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence.\nSUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said in a statement to the Governor’s Office, “Governor Hochul’s continued leadership has placed SUNY and New York State at the forefront of harnessing AI for the public good.” The SUNY Board of Trustees also acknowledged the Governor and State Legislature for expanding access to artificial intelligence technology.\nAs part of the initiative, the University at Albany is partnering with institutions such as SUNY Oneonta and Hudson Valley Community College to expand AI education and develop applied research projects. In Buffalo, an “AI in Action” initiative includes 11 campuses across Central and Western New York, offering workshops focused on curriculum development and ethical AI use. Stony Brook University is also collaborating with other campuses on an eight-week research program involving multiple academic disciplines.\nThe Empire AI partnership includes more than $500 million in combined public and private funding. Announced last year, Empire AI includes plans to expand computing capacity through projects such as Empire AI Beta. In addition, Binghamton University received a $30 million gift to establish the Center for AI Responsibility and Research, along with a $25 million research capital investment from SUNY.","wordCount":300},"cachedAt":1770820440816},"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/feb/10/trump-told-police-fled-seeing-teenage-girls-jeffrey-epstein-fbi-files/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820441337},"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/23/trumps-politics-gilded-age":{"data":{"author":"Peter Stone","date":"Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:00:12 GMT","siteName":"The Guardian","imageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b8a707c800fbd3e162089394c5c80183f7b58ca/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none&crop=none","text":"Major donors reap influence and material benefits, ethics experts argue, as money and governance intertwine\nDonald Trump’s “pay-to-play” governing and fundraising style is helping forge a new gilded age where many super rich donors to Trump’s Maga Inc Pac and other top Trump causes are reaping big political and financial gains, including lax regulations, federal contracts and other benefits, say scholars and analysts.\nThe transactional style of the US president has been a financial boon to cryptocurrency, AI and fossil fuel interests, among others, which have showered seven- and eight-figure donations on Trump’s Super Pac, inaugural committee and pet projects such as his oft-touted mammoth White House ballroom.\nAccording to public filings and Trump’s statements, the president’s Super Pac hauled in a stunning $300m in 2025, which analysts expect will mainly be spent on the 2026 midterm elections to help the GOP keep control of Congress, and Trump’s lavish ballroom project has raised $350m.\nAmong the top business winners under Trump, the crypto industry stands out as benefitting from strong administration backing while making multi-million dollar donations to his Super Pac and ballroom. Notably, crypto has been a bonanza worth over $1bn for Trump and his family who launched their own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in the fall of 2024 during his presidential run.\nWhat’s more, a number of multibillionaires led by high tech and AI titan Elon Musk have seen their personal fortunes soar. Musk, the world’s richest man, donated a record $290m to help elect Trump and was tapped by Trump to lead his drive to slash the federal workforce and spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).\nForbes magazine pegged Musk’s net worth at the end of 2025 at $726bn or some $200bn more than he was worth when Trump took office; last year too, Musk’s SpaceX notched billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts including for the Golden Dome missile defense satellite system.\nExperts say some of the Trump administration’s policies, coupled with the influence of giant donors, have echoes of the gilded age in the late 1800s, when industrialists and financiers amassed great fortunes with monopolies in railroads, oil and banks, earning them the moniker of robber barons; the era became notorious for graft and bribes of government officials at many levels, and sparked reforms and regulations.\nUnder Trump, a number of corporate and individual donors to his favored causes have benefited from less regulation, new government contracts, pardons and fewer federal investigations, analysts say; concurrently, Trump has at times mocked concerns about affordability as a “hoax” or “con job”, even though millions of Americans have faced rising costs for electricity, healthcare and food.\nOver the past year, Trump’s herculean fundraising with its “pay-to-play” approach has reached “unprecedented” levels, say experts and scholars.\n“Trump’s unprecedented fundraising for his Maga Pac and his White House ballroom vanity project from wealthy donors and corporate interests who stand to benefit from his administration’s decisions are among the most recent examples of how he views governance as a pay-to-play business,” said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now teaches law at American University.\n“Those who contribute enough have reason to expect they will get a large return on their investment, whether it’s the end of a government investigation or the government’s approval of a business deal. Trump appears to be happy making a mockery of the basic principle that the leader of our democracy should be making decisions free from real and apparent conflict of interests.”\nNoble added: “Like the post-civil war gilded age, there appears to be a sharp rise in what, in any sane time, we would treat as outright government corruption. For example, many of the administration’s policies and actions appear to be influenced by individuals, corporations and foreign actors helping increase the wealth of the president and his family or contributing to his political war chest.”\nScholars too stress that the optics of influence peddling with the ballroom’s financing, and other moves by Trump that have benefitted wealthy interests and Trump personally have reached new and dangerous levels.\n“In the grand scheme of things, the costly ballroom, and destruction of the East Wing, is not the biggest issue of 2026,” Princeton historian Julian Zelizer told the Guardian. “But the aggressive nature through which he is pursuing these changes, the extravagant nature of the renovation, and the illusive plus real policy connections to some of those financing the project matters. The symbolism won’t sit right with many Americans who can barely pay rent.\n“More importantly, the problem of political corruption has been a central concern in American politics since the founding. The president’s family has entered the crypto business and done quite well financially in it as the administration has deregulated the industry. Further, the line between his family’s overseas real-estate interests and foreign policy is often impossible to see. When a great deal of money is flowing into the White House, the perception of elitism, excessive wealth, and corrupt ties can become a significant issue in the minds of voters.”\nTrump and the White House have repeatedly rejected charges that his policies and family’s business dealings in crypto, hotels and other areas have posed any conflicts of interest, stressing that his decisions are driven by putting America’s interests first.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times this month, Trump said that “I have a very honest family” and pointed out that he never took his presidential salary. He also asserted that George Washington conducted other business as president, which he suggested justified allowing his sons to pursue business deals worldwide.\nTrump said he “prohibited” his sons “from doing business in my first term, and I got absolutely no credit for it”, he said. “I didn’t have to do that. And it’s really unfair to them,” Trump added. “I found out that nobody cared, and I’m allowed to.”\nUnlike other presidents, Trump has declined to put his assets in a completely blind trust or divest from his businesses, moves that ethics experts have urged.\nIn a statement to NPR last November, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged or will ever engage in conflicts of interest.”\nStill, Democrats in Congress have hit Trump hard about potential conflicts of interest they see with his family’s lucrative crypto business dealings that he profits from, and potential pay-for-play abuses involving ballroom donors and administration policies.\nFor Trump, the political and personal stakes are high, with this year’s midterm elections looming in November. At a retreat for House Republican members on January 6, Trump noted pointedly that if they lose their now thin House majority, as many analysts predict will happen, he expects that “I’ll get impeached.”\n“You got to win the midterms, because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\nAlthough Trump’s Super Pac raised $300m in 2025, two veteran Republican strategists say that it’s aiming to haul in another $200m before the elections to help keep Congress in GOP hands.\nAmong the issues that could create voter blowback in the elections and imperil Trump’s agenda, his political promotion of cryptocurrency and personal interests in the business stand out in some respects, say academics in economics and law.\nAfter years of calling crypto a “scam” and a “disaster waiting to happen”, Trump became an avid crypto promoter during his 2024 campaign vowing to make the US “the crypto capital of the world,” with lighter regulations and fewer federal investigations.\nTrump’s inaugural committee raked in $14m in contributions from the crypto industry, and Trump-affiliated committees in the election raised about $3.6m from crypto interests, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics. OpenSecrets totals do not include donations that were made in bitcoin or other crypto tokens which would raise the amounts from crypto interests by a few million dollars.\nIn the fall of 2024, Trump also announced that he and his family were launching their own crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, which, since its founding, has been run in part by his sons, Eric and Don Jr. The president has said he is not involved at all in its business.\nStill, multiple media reports indicate Trump’s personal wealth has risen significantly due in good measure to his family crypto holdings, which tend to fluctuate in value: in September, for instance, Forbes estimated Trump’s crypto ventures added about $2bn to his net worth to help it hit a record $7.3bn. But in November Forbes pegged his net worth at $6.3bn due in part to declines in crypto ventures.\nAs president, Trump has issued executive orders helping the crypto industry by easing regulations and oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a marked shift from under Joe Biden, which Trump had promised in a talk in mid-2024 at a major bitcoin conference.\nFurther, Trump backed a bill last year, dubbed the Genius Act, which the crypto industry lobbied hard for, to set a regulatory framework for a popular type of crypto known as stablecoins, whose value is often tied to that of the dollar and in which World Liberty Financial has sizable stakes.\nA number of Democrats in Congress, including senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, fought to toughen the measure with more consumer and financial safeguards plus anti-corruption provisions, but did not get all they wanted before the bill passed and Trump signed it in July.\nStrikingly, Trump last May hosted a private dinner at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, which drew some 220 top purchasers who altogether ponied up $148m on a Trump meme coin, a largely ceremonial coin dubbed $Trump, which the president promoted on Truth Social right before his inauguration.\nThe Chinese-born billionaire Justin Sun, who spent $20m on the coin, boasted at the dinner that he received a $100,000 Trump-branded watch for being the largest purchaser. Significantly, Sun also poured at least $75m into World Liberty Financial to become its leading investor and an adviser.\nSun’s largesse to Trump crypto ventures came after he was sued by the SEC in 2023 on allegations of fraudulent market manipulation and misconduct involving three other crypto enterprises of his, including the Tron Foundation.\nLast February, as the SEC began to ease oversight of crypto ventures, it paused the case against Sun, which fueled strong concerns among watchdog groups and Democrats.\nSun, who denied the SEC charges in 2023 and called them baseless, last year indicated that he was in talks with the SEC to settle the charges after the agency announced its pause.\nTrump sparked other criticisms in October when he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the multibillionaire who founded Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, which earlier in 2025 signed a $2bn investment deal involving World Liberty Financial that is expected to yield tens of millions yearly to the Trump family.\nZhao had pleaded guilty in 2023 to breaking anti-money laundering laws, served a four-month sentence and resigned as Binance’s chief executive officer, but is still its largest shareholder.\nBinance agreed in 2023 to pay more than $4bn to settle related DoJ charges of violating anti money–laundering laws.\nAfter his pardon, which Binance and Zhao hired top lobbyists to push for, Zhao posted on X that he was “deeply grateful” and pledged to “do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto”, which aligns well with Trump’s promises and his crypto deregulatory moves.\nIn a 60 Minutes interview in November, Trump raised eyebrows with his claim that “I don’t know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch-hunt.”\nCornell economist Eswar Prasad, who has tracked the growth of crypto in the US, sees Trump and his family’s lucrative stake in World Liberty Financial and his personal memecoin coupled with his strong backing for looser industry regulations raising “pay-to-play” concerns.\n“Trump and his family have hardly been shy about cozying up to crypto tycoons, and have been quite brazen in their pay-for-play approach to this sector,” Prasad told the Guardian.\n“Crypto executives willing to provide financial support to the Trump family’s crypto-related ventures have received access to the president and top officials, favorable regulatory rulings, and even pardons when convicted of crimes. The connections between the Trump administration and the crypto industry run deep and wide, and it has become clear that the US government machinery will be openly deployed to support this industry,” he added.\nPrasad cautioned: “Various pieces of crypto-related legislation backed by the Trump administration feature relatively modest consumer and investor protections, and brush away most of the financial stability concerns related to this industry. The Trump administration’s light touch approach to regulation suggests that even these limitations might be weakened over time and in practice.”\n“This also opens the door to crypto serving as a conduit for illicit finance and for lubricating a wide range of illegal activities.”\nSimilarly, Richard Briffault, a Columbia law professor and expert on government ethics, said he sees Trump’s crypto ventures and his May memecoin bash last year as “unprecedented”.\n“I don’t think there’s been anything like this in American history,” Briffault said. “Trump is marketing access to himself as a way to profit his memecoin. People are paying to meet Trump and he’s the regulator-in-chief.”\nTrump has rejected allegations that his family’s growing crypto ventures pose any conflicts, and stressed that he is not involved in World Liberty Financial’s operations, but his sons Eric and Don Jr handle much of its management.\nIn a statement to NPR in November, Leavitt stressed: “The administration is fulfilling the president’s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.”\nTrump, however, has reaped other benefits from his crypto links that are palpable in fundraising for his Super Pac and ballroom, whose estimated costs have soared from $200m to $400m, and become a microcosm of his new gilded age.\nTop donors to the Super Pac are leaders from the crypto and AI sectors including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, who together with his wife ponied up $25m, and Foris Dax Inc, the US arm of the firm that runs Crypto.com, which last year chipped in $30m, or about a tenth of the Pac’s total haul.\nOther top donors to Trump’s Super Pac or his ballroom project include Binance, the AI chip giant Nvidia, shale oil multi billionaire Harold Hamm, and the billionaire twin brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who founded the crypto firm Gemini.\nAccording to a report from Public Citizen, many of the seven-figure donors for the lavish ballroom have benefited under Trump from government contracts, less regulation and in other ways including defense giant Lockheed, Nvidia, Meta, Google and cryptocurrency firms Ripple and Coinbase.\nTo spur donor enthusiasm, Trump last summer touted the need for a mammoth ballroom to host state dinners and proclaimed it would be the “greatest ballroom anywhere in the world”. Trump has stressed the ballroom won’t involve federal funding, but will be paid for by private funds from “many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly”.\nTrump has emphasized the giant ballroom will be able to host 999 people for large state dinners, and possibly inaugurations. In Trump’s eyes, the ballroom will be an overdue renovation that’s a “great legacy project”, to restore “classical American architecture” to the White House, and replace “unsightly” and costly tents that have long been used to host large state dinners.\nTo make way for the 90,000 sq ft ballroom, the East Wing of the White House last October was abruptly torn down, which the White House justified for structural reasons and claimed it was more economical.\nIn October, too, Trump fired all six members of a federal agency, the Commission on Fine Arts, that’s slated to review the project, and indicated he would appoint new members who shared his “America First” agenda. But it took Trump until 15 January to appoint four new members who have been described as Trump loyalists, including the architect who provided the ballroom’s first design plans.\nMeanwhile, to boost fundraising for the ballroom, Trump in mid-October hosted a glitzy dinner at the White House for about 130 wealthy individual and corporate donors for the project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, a multibillionaire, after the dinner disclosed his help for Trump’s glamorous ballroom vision which reportedly was about $1m.\nHuang has said that he was “proud and delighted to help contribute in a small way” to the project, which he described as a “historic and national monument”.\nTrump last month signed off on Nvidia selling a powerful chip to the US’s tech rival China, a key goal for the company, and indicated the US would impose a 25% tariff on some Nvidia chips. Trump in December also signed an executive order aimed at thwarting what he dubbed as “onerous” state AI regulations, a move that many AI interests pushed for, although all 50 states have introduced AI legislation and more than three dozen states have enacted at least one measure.\nBriffault voiced strong concerns about the ways that fundraising for Trump’s favored projects such as the ballroom seem to dovetail with some policy moves that benefit big donors.\n“What’s striking is how close the ‘winners’ under Trump match the ‘givers’ to Trump – givers either to support his Pac, or Trump family enterprises like his crypto meme coin and other crypto ventures, or to Trump pet projects like the ballroom,” said Briffault.\n“There may not be any explicit quid pro quos, but when you compare the winners with the givers you’ve got the essence of conflict of interest – people giving to win beneficial government actions – and a government inclined to do things for people who financially support the president and his interests.”\nSome top Democrats such as senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut are investigating the fundraising behind Trump’s ballroom.\n“Trump appears to be using his massive $400m gilded ballroom as a vehicle for corruption,” Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the permanent subcommittee on investigations, told the Guardian.\n“At a time when Americans are struggling to afford healthcare and make ends meet, Donald Trump has spent his time cozying up to billionaires, big tech, and major corporations to solicit donations for a personal luxury. The American people deserve to know what Trump may have agreed to in exchange for these donations. I’ll continue to press for answers.”\nLikewise, Democratic Senator Warren, condemned Trump’s ballroom project as symbolic of other “influence-peddling” tools Trump has given the green light to.\n“This is the most corrupt administration in history, and Donald Trump’s gold-encrusted ballroom seems to be his latest tool for influence-peddling and bribery. The American people shouldn’t have to wonder whether their government works for them or for the giant corporations and billionaires lining up to curry Trump’s favor,” Warren said.\nLooking ahead to the fall elections, some former Republican members of Congress also are sharply critical of Trump’s gilded age fundraising modus operandi.\n“Trump surely has ushered in a new gilded age in America,” said former\nRepublican Michigan representative Dave Trott. “Everything is for sale from pardons to the ballroom, and Trump does not care who gets hurt.\n“Meanwhile, the robber barons in corporate America are buying influence while most families struggle to make ends meet. The inequities and corruption are no different than the 1880s, and it will be interesting to see what the voters think in the midterm elections.”","wordCount":3261},"cachedAt":1770820442191},"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2026/01/first-lady-melania-trump-inspires-americas-children-to-be-curious-use-ai-to-achieve-their-career-ambitions/":{"data":{"date":"Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:37:08 GMT","siteName":"The White House","imageUrl":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg","text":"First Lady Melania Trump advanced her mission to improve America’s children’s understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) today.

The operation has also resulted in two civilian deaths during encounters with federal agents.\n“This flood of new litigation imposes an enormous burden on this U.S. Attorney’s Office,” Daniel Rosen, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota, wrote in a recent court filing. His office has redirected resources from other civil enforcement work to handle immigration detention challenges.\nICE attorney Julie Le described the workload to a federal judge this week. “The system sucks, this job sucks,” Ms. Le said in court, according to CNN, saying she had volunteered for the Minnesota assignment but found herself working late nights with inadequate guidance. She was removed from the assignment the following day.\nMinnesota’s chief federal judge Patrick Schiltz found that ICE violated at least 96 court orders in the state during January. In one case, a detained immigrant ordered released by a judge was instead flown to Texas and wasn’t returned to Minnesota for nearly two weeks.\nThe 427 habeas petitions filed in Minnesota in January compared to the typical 10 or fewer filed in previous months.

The consent decree, signed by Judge T. Kent Wetherell in the Northern District of Florida on February 4, declares the Biden-era parole program unlawful and prohibits the federal government from attempting comparable programs during the agreement’s duration.\nUnder the settlement, parole remains available only for traditional limited circumstances, such as medical emergencies or when a foreigner is needed to assist criminal investigations. However, it can no longer be deployed in the categorical manner used by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas under the Biden administration. Immigration expert Andrew Arthur estimates that parole usage would drop to perhaps a couple hundred cases annually, compared to nearly 3 million migrants paroled during the Biden era.\nThe consent decree specifically prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from creating categorical processing pathways for migrants at the border primarily to address detention capacity concerns or improve operational efficiency. This includes any policy that shifts removal proceedings from the border to the interior or postpones their initiation.\nThe settlement emerged from a 2023 lawsuit filed by then-Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, now a U.S. senator, and was finalized by her successor, Attorney General James Uthmeier. Florida utilized a “sue-and-settle” strategy, where a lawsuit is filed against a friendly administration and both parties agree to binding policy changes, bypassing Congress and standard administrative rulemaking processes. While this tactic has historically been employed more by left-leaning activists, the Florida settlement demonstrates that conservatives have adopted the approach.\nCritics, including Jennifer Coberly of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, argue the deal undermines the law by restricting executive discretion for 15 years. The settlement can only be modified or terminated with consent from both Florida and the federal government, subject to court approval, and a federal judge retains continuing jurisdiction to enforce it.\nThe Trump administration has already moved to suspend Biden’s parole programs and is working to remove individuals who entered through what officials characterize as legally questionable policies.

At the end he was bad for crypto. Big mistake to have him as president,\" tweeted crypto influencer Carl Runefelt.\nOther major accounts posted self-deprecating memes, with one writing: \"When Trump said we wouldn't have to pay taxes on crypto gains, I didn't realize he was removing the gains.\"\nThe other side: There's no clear sign yet that crypto's revolt will carry into elections, particularly with industry PACs gearing up to spend heavily in support of Republicans.\nCrypto influencers expressed outrage Thursday after a top Democratic account appeared to mock the bitcoin crash as a blow to Trump and his supporters.\n\"Neither the President nor his family has ever engaged — or will ever engage — in conflicts of interest,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\"President Trump proudly made the United States the crypto capital of the world through executive actions, supporting legislation like the GENIUS Act, and other commonsense policies to drive innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\"\nThe big picture: The backlash captures a deeper problem for Trump: Niche and newly mobilized constituencies he courted in 2024 are growing disillusioned with his presidency.\nPodcast populists: The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files and aggressive immigration enforcement has alienated some anti-establishment podcasters who helped shape his appeal to young men in 2024, including Joe Rogan and comedian Andrew Schulz.\nNonwhite voters: Trump's support among Black and Latino Americans has slipped since he made major gains in 2024, as cost-of-living pressures continue to weigh heavily on these communities.\nFarmers: Even after Trump rolled out a $12 billion \"bridge payment\" to offset tariff-related losses, agricultural leaders warned this week of potential \"widespread collapse\" if Congress fails to act.\nThe intrigue: Even traditional Republican constituencies have expressed discontent with some of Trump's policies.\nGun owners: The administration's response to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti — who was legally carrying a firearm when he was killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis — has dismayed some Second Amendment advocates.\nAntiabortion activists: The FDA's approval of a generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone — along with Trump's call for Republicans to be \"flexible\" on federal abortion funding — has angered key pro-life leaders.\nIran hawks: Foreign policy hardliners and diaspora groups want Trump to follow through on his promise to help Iranian protesters topple the regime — frustrated that he has opted, for now, to pursue diplomacy.\nThe bottom line: Trump's polling troubles reflect not one backlash, but many. At the heart of his slump are the very issues that powered his 2024 win: affordability and immigration.","wordCount":744},"cachedAt":1770820446567},"https://www.wired.com/story/letter-salesforce-employees-sent-after-marc-benioffs-ice-comments/":{"data":{"author":"Lauren Goode","date":"Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:25:00 GMT","siteName":"Wired News","imageUrl":"https://media.wired.com/photos/698b9e303a2ff3469363c0cc/3:2/w_2240,c_limit/biz-salesforce-2172254667.jpg","text":"Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images\nGet our Tracker: ICE newsletter to see what’s happening with immigration enforcement and what’s coming next\nSIGN UP\nBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including class action waiver and arbitration provisions), and acknowledge our privacy policy.\nEmployees at Salesforce are circulating an internal letter to chief executive Marc Benioff calling on him to denounce recent actions by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, prohibit the use of Salesforce software by immigration agents, and back federal legislation that would significantly reform the agency.\nThe letter specifically cites the “recent killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis” as catalysts, calling them the “devastating indictment of a system that has discarded human decency.” It’s unclear how many signatories the letter has received so far.\nThe letter, which has not been reported on previously, is being organized amid Salesforce’s annual leadership kickoff event this week in Las Vegas. During an appearance at the event earlier today, Benioff asked international employees to stand to thank them for attending. He then joked that ICE agents were in the building monitoring them, according to current and former Salesforce employees who spoke to WIRED.\nBenioff’s remarks sparked immediate backlash among employees. “Lots of people are furious,” says one source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Another source tells WIRED that the internal pushback today was significantly more forceful than after Benioff made other controversial comments last fall supporting President Trump’s call to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco to address crime.\nSalesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Business Insider and 404 Media previously reported on Benioff’s remarks and the reaction to them inside Salesforce.\nGot a Tip?\nAre you a current or former Salesforce employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at ChaoticGoode.12\n“We are deeply troubled by leaked documentation revealing that Salesforce has pitched AI technology to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help the agency ‘expeditiously’ hire 10,000 new agents and vet tip-line reports,” the letter reads. “Providing ‘Agentforce’ infrastructure to scale a mass deportation agenda that currently detains 66,000 people—73 percent of whom have no criminal record—represents a fundamental betrayal of our commitment to the ethical use of technology.”\nThe letter argues that Benioff’s voice “carries unique weight in Washington,” pointing to an episode last fall when Trump called off an ICE deployment in San Francisco after what appeared to be outreach from Bay Area tech leaders, including Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. It urges Benioff to use that influence as a “corporate statesman” to issue a public statement condemning what it calls ICE’s unconstitutional conduct and to commit Salesforce to clear “red lines” barring the use of its cloud and AI products for state violence.\nBenioff has weighed in on both national and local political issues for years. He supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and later became one of the most high-profile backers of Proposition C, a failed San Francisco ballot measure that would have raised taxes to fund programs to address homelessness. In 2020, he donated to the primary campaigns of some Democratic presidential candidates, including Kamala Harris.\nBut since Trump returned to the White House in January, Benioff has signaled greater support for some Republican leaders. In one interview, he said he strives to stay nonpartisan because he also owns Time magazine. But he also joked that, while he declined to contribute to Trump’s inauguration fund directly, he had “donated” a photo of the president on the magazine's cover, which named him its 2024 Person of the Year. “He can use the Time magazine cover for free,” Benioff said in the interview with Fortune.\nBenioff also faced backlash from Salesforce employees last fall when he suggested the National Guard should be sent to San Francisco to tackle crime ahead of the company’s annual conference in the city. He later apologized for the remarks, explaining they stemmed from genuine concerns about safety. He later reversed his stance and joined Nvidia’s Huang in asking Trump to refrain from sending troops.\nThat incident occurred as Salesforce was reportedly pitching its technology to ICE, touting that it could be used to help the agency achieve its goal to “nearly triple its work force by hiring 10,000 new officers and agents expeditiously.”\nSalesforce has lost a number of top executives in recent weeks. Last month, WIRED reported that Denise Dresser, CEO of the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging app Slack, was leaving to become OpenAI’s chief revenue officer. Ryan Aytay, a 19-year Salesforce veteran who was formerly Benioff’s chief of staff and most recently led the company's visualization platform Tableau, also announced his departure last week.\nAdam Evans, who was executive vice president and general manager of AI at Salesforce and helped lead its Agentforce platform, recently left his role, too. And on Monday, AMD announced that Ariel Kelman, Salesforce’s president and chief marketing officer, was starting a similar job at the semiconductor giant.\nAdditional reporting by Paresh Dave.","wordCount":852},"cachedAt":1770820446942},"https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/govt-mandates-3-hour-takedown-of-deepfakes-tightens-ai-content-rules":{"data":{"author":"Vinay Mishra","date":"Tue, 10 Feb 2026 12:24:00 GMT","siteName":"Free Press Journal","imageUrl":"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2025-11-04/ny7ggsoe/digital-art-ai-technology-background23-2151719627.avif?width=1200","text":"The Centre on Tuesday introduced stricter compliance requirements for social media and online platforms regarding artificial intelligence (AI)-generated and synthetic content, mandating that flagged material, including deepfakes, be removed within three hours of orders from courts or competent authorities.\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) notified amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.

The leaders’ press conference was a particularly feeble and disingenuous attempt to persuade everyone that all is now sweetness and light. In truth, it was nothing but a hastily assembled showcase of platitudes, gaslighting and ill-concealed tensions that no one’s buying. The Liberals and Nationals act like bit-part hopefuls at a soap opera audition. Together, they struggle to even stage a credible pantomime. It’s a pity that in neither case is there a coherent script with a decent storyline. Adrian Connelly, Springwood\nAmazing how we now have a Coalition reunited to “help those struggling Australian families who are doing it tough” when their values have always counted more for the upper half of the economic spectrum. Thankfully, Labor has, besides other things, managed to lift wages from the floor to which they were so long nailed during the last Coalition tenure. People do have memories. Wolf Kempa, Lithgow\nI don’t understand why the Liberals didn’t stay split and go it alone and field Liberal candidates in Nationals seats next election. They’d have a chance in a few of them, I reckon, since the Nats now represent miners and corporate agribusiness rather than farmers and rural townsfolk. Liberal leader Sussan Ley herself won her seat off the Nats when Tim Fischer retired, so there’s a template. They might also get some metropolitan seats back if they come up with reasonable policies and good candidates, if that’s not too much to ask. Daniel Flesch, Bellingen\nThe rise of the One Nation vote as the Coalition falters may be even better for Labor than John Anderson suggests (“One Nation’s rise a gift for Labor, warns Anderson”, February 9). I believe there would be a significant number of Coalition voters, especially Liberals, who would not go as far as preferencing One Nation. Al Svirskis, Mount Druitt\nMisleading minority\nThe full-page advertisement claiming “Jews say No” to President Herzog’s visit gives a misleading impression of sentiment within Sydney’s Jewish community, as does David Leser’s article (“I’m Jewish. I live in Bondi. But I take no comfort from Herzog’s visit”, February 9). The Jewish Council of Australia, with roughly 1300 members in a national Jewish population of at least 100,000, cannot reasonably claim to speak for the community. The body that maintains representative engagement with governments is the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak communal organisation encompassing more than 200 affiliated groups across education, welfare, religious, cultural and state representative sectors. Readers should bear this in mind when assessing claims to represent Jewish opinion in Australia. John Kempler, Rose Bay\nJudging from the 600 signatures published in Monday’s Herald by the Jewish Council of Australia, it would seem that many Jewish Australians feel the same way as David Leser who, in his article, asks “how could one bear to watch a country that claims to represent the Jewish people destroy so utterly the very fabric of a society?” Elections are due to be held in Israel in October this year, but pundits have been suggesting that PM Benjamin Netanyahu will maximise his chances by calling it early. Hopefully, there will be enough voters who agree with Leser and apply Albert Einstein’s dictum that “relativity applies to physics, not ethics”. Peter Nash, Fairlight\nMonday’s letter from Australian Jews opposing President Isaac Herzog’s visit points to a widening gap between government decision-making and community reality. What’s baffling people isn’t the geopolitics, it’s the judgment. We are already dealing with enough to justify a royal commission into how fractured and brittle our society has become. Communities are raw. Trust is thin. People are tired and on edge. Then the government decides this is the moment to invite someone whose presence guarantees outrage, division and disbelief. For myself and many Australians, this isn’t controversial in a technical sense; it just feels seriously weird. Like watching leaders ignore every social signal flashing red. What makes it worse is that this time the fracture line runs straight through Jewish communities themselves. Good leadership sometimes means choosing restraint. Sometimes it means reading the moment and deciding that symbolism can wait. When leaders miss that, confusion spreads, people dig in and everyone else pays the price. Lynne Strong, Jamberoo\nI am outraged by the advertisement that claims to speak for Australian Jews in opposing President Herzog’s visit. These individuals do not represent the majority of the Australian Jewish community, rather a fringe minority seeking to delegitimise the Jewish state while our community grieves for the 15 people murdered in a terrorist attack. President Isaac Herzog asks the question these protesters cannot answer: “Where are you all when tens of thousands of Iranian innocent civilians are butchered by their own regime? Where’s the outcry?” Their silence is deafening. Their selective outrage against the world’s only Jewish state is transparent antisemitism. This advertisement betrays our community, emboldens our enemies and gives comfort to those who seek to divide Australia. Charlie Nightingale, Vaucluse\nThe opinion piece by David Leser is missing an important piece of information. This is common among critics of the state of Israel. Namely, how do they think the Gazan and West Bank problem should have been solved? What constructive solution do they offer? I’m not sure that engaging in “robust debate” with Hamas and the Gazans who support them, as suggested in his piece, is going to work. Every last Jew left Gaza in 2005, and look what happened. Ben Basger, Bondi Junction\nNo double standard\nCorrrespondent Alan Shroot wonders why Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit is considered divisive and suggests other visiting foreign dignitaries would not get similar treatment (Letters, February 9). Maybe if they presided over a government that had killed tens of thousands of mainly innocent people over the past three years, and maimed, displaced, deprived and disenfranchised hundreds of thousands more, they too would not get the warm welcome Shroot thinks they would. Kevin Hunt, Kenthurst\nAlan Shroot observes that no one would bat an eyelid if the leader of the Greek state visited our country, yet Isaac Herzog’s visit is criticised. Could that be because Greece is not fighting a bitter and prolonged war? I’d suggest that Vladimir Putin would also receive a hostile reception from sections of our community if he visited. There is no double standard here. Stephen Foster, Glebe\nGood news\nKudos to The Sydney Morning Herald for its gesture to students (“Unlimited Herald access at UNSW”, February 9). Hopefully, it will encourage our future leaders to rely more on bona fide journalists than on TikTok influencers for news, which has become a growing trend. Fifteen years ago, I asked my law students if they read newspapers. About 40 to 50 per cent said they got their news from online news sites, some even via actual newspapers. Three or four years ago, I found that social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube and TikTok had become their sole source of information. It seems objective news reporting has been replaced by subjective opinion. These days experienced journalists compete with 20-year-old influencers in the news marketplace and risk falling into the abyss of becoming “content creators” chasing followers, rather than impartial news reporters. Marshall McLuhan, known as the father of media studies, coined the phrase “The medium is the message.” This is even more relevant today than it was when he wrote it in the 1960s. May the Herald be successful in dragging students back to traditional sources of news. Irene Nemes, Rose Bay\nA very interesting development that students and staff at UNSW will have free access to the Herald. Vice chancellor Attila Brungs said it was an opportunity “for our community to easily engage with credible news, diversify their news perspectives and encourage engagement on the issues that matter”. That says something about the assault on truth unleashed on the internet and social media. Of course, the Herald is not the only source of credible news. The Conversation, backed by universities and journalists, has a free daily newsletter. The Daily Aus, started by young people for young people, also survives. On the other hand, some young people I know have used the power of the internet, software and AI to share direct access to primary source information about the Epstein files, proving that the internet is not all evil. The thoughtful journalism found in the Herald will add something valuable to university education. Gary Barnes, Mosman\nInvestment in students\nTo learn that $300 million over four years could support allied health students is welcome news (“Laura’s studies will help fix the health skills shortage. But she can’t afford the unpaid work her degree requires”, February 9). The strain of unpaid placements on these students can be debilitating. Even modest financial support would go a long way in helping psychology students afford such necessities as travel to and from their placements. This would give them the flexibility to work over a range of clinical and community settings. Diversity of placement experience is not a luxury – it is what builds a strong, capable and adaptable mental health workforce. When students are forced to limit their placements based on cost rather than on learning value, the whole profession loses. Fully supporting students through mandatory placements is a smart workforce investment that will pay dividends for years to come. Dr Kylie Henderson, Brisbane (Qld)\nSlow but steady\nIt’s hard to find a supporter of the CGT concessions (Letters, February 7). Even those who avail themselves of it seem to know that it is unfair and heavily biased. But the suggested change from 50 per cent to 33 per cent is paltry. It should be a staged reduction of say 10 per cent over five years until the beast is forever gone. To paraphrase Crocodile Dundee, “that’s not a cut – this is a cut.” Then we can move on to negative gearing. Peter Vernon, Sawtell\nPower imbalance\nHaving worked in community healthcare for many years, I was horrified to read of the proposed changes to power bills by the Australian Energy Market Commission (“The power bill charge that will sting low-earners $200 more”, February 8). To financially punish low-income households and others who at a great cost have invested in solar and batteries is shameful. Finding elderly clients huddled in their homes in the middle of winter with layers of clothing, blankets and beanies because heating is too expensive is a confronting sight. Absurdly, better-off families who use more energy will benefit most from the proposed rule change. Sarah Rolls, Orange\nFood for thought\nWe had a lovely visit to the new Sydney Fish Market last week (“A must-see icon or awkward honeymoon? The trouble with the new Sydney Fish Market”, February 9). We arrived by public transport and, after doing the circuit, nabbed a table to eat our seafood lunch – without a chip being stolen. However, a lengthy wait in line for one of the few ladies’ loos was annoyingly familiar. It would really help to have handwashing stations available outside, so people can wash their prawny fingers. Lisa Clarke, Watsons Bay\nFood forethought\nI thoroughly enjoyed Dani Valent’s article, not as a gardener but as a gardener’s wife (“The 10-minute backyard habit I used as a stress-buster”, February 7). And it’s all true. My husband is the calmest of men, however, the big winner of his gardening exploits is our neighbourhood. His small and beautiful front garden is a showstopper. Colour abounds. There is not a day that wonderful comments are not heard. He talks to everyone when working on it. It sparks joy. And any extra produce from the herbs, citrus and veggies is placed out the front and finds another home. He is a testament to the benefits of gardening – and social interaction. I just bask in his glow, although I couldn’t name a plant if I fell over it. Wendy Atkins, Cooks Hill\nClub and cudgels\nAs a lifelong Marxist, it’s a good time for me to quote our moustachioed leader Groucho, who said “I would never join a club that would have me as a member.” May Ricky never darken a towel at that establishment (“Royal rumble: How Ponting missed the cut for membership of ‘elite’ golf club”, February 9). Andrew Raymond, Parramatta\nWould it really be terrible to laugh at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club members who kept Ricky Ponting from becoming a member of their illustrious institution? No? So, let’s just have a good laugh. It’s the only appropriate response. Greg Baker, Fitzroy Falls\nBring out your Binns\nIf I really thought there had been a cause and effect following on from Keith Binns’ letter complaining about e-bikes, then I would say hand over all the space on the letters pages to Mr Binns for one day and allow him to write about every issue that needs fixing (Letters, February 9).

Sure, today's savings account rates are not as competitive as they were a year or two ago, but they're still relatively high and worth exploring. And, if you open a money market account specifically, you won't need to sacrifice access to your money as you would with a certificate of deposit (CD) account. Money market accounts also come with other features, like check-writing abilities, that neither traditional and high-yield savings accounts have.\nTo better evaluate the benefit of this account type currently, it helps to know what a good money market account interest rate is considered to be at the start of 2026. With a variety of options to choose from online right now, having this information can help you determine which lenders are offering the best rates … and which ones may be worth avoiding. So, what is actually a good money market account interest rate now? That's what we'll detail below.\nSee how much interest you could be earning with your top savings account options here.\nWhat's a good money market account interest rate in 2026?\nMoney market account interest rates of 4% or slightly higher are becoming increasingly difficult to find. But they are still available, and with some time spent shopping around online, savers may be able to locate one now. In other words, if you can find a money market account with a rate of 4% or better currently, you can consider it to be a \"good\" one and the account worth opening (assuming fees and maintenance costs are low).\nTo find this account, however, you may need to forego your local banking branch and instead be willing to open one online. Online banks often have lower operating costs than banks with physical locations. Those savings then translate to higher interest rates paid to savers. So, if you want that money market account rate over 4% now, an online bank offers the best way to find it.\nThat being said, savers shouldn't make a perfect rate their end goal here, either. Money market account interest rates are variable and subject to change based on market conditions. Waiting for a perfect rate could mean missing out on interest-earning opportunities that are already available. Take the time, then, to research your options, but be realistic about how high rates here are likely to be, too.\nShop for the top savings accounts online today.\nWhat about a high-yield savings account?\nHigh-yield savings accounts are viable alternatives to money market ones and some savers may find that their best recourse is to split their funds between both. High-yield savings account interest rates are comparable to the top money market account interest rates right now. And while high-yield savings accounts don't have all the same features as money market accounts do, that may not be a deal-breaker for each saver.\nAt the same time, rates here are also variable and likely to change over time. To earn as much interest as you can as quickly as you can, then it makes sense to get started with a high-yield savings account sooner rather than later.\nThe bottom line\nA good money market account interest rate is considered to be around 4% now, in mid-February 2026. But rates here can and will change over time, so it makes sense to start earning that 4% right away, especially if additional Fed rate cuts are issued later in the year. Consider speaking with a banking representative, who can answer any questions you may have and help you get started with an account and interest rate that's right for you now.\n Edited by Angelica Leicht","wordCount":668},"cachedAt":1770820462492},"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-07/interest-rate-hikes-capital-gains-tax-federal-budget/106294868":{"data":{"author":"","date":"Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:00:00 GMT","siteName":"ABC Online","imageUrl":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e7a63c90e05eabe1fb062688b4413f28?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3510&cropW=6240&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","text":"As the opposition and government wrestled in the hay barn over who's to blame for this week's Reserve Bank interest rate increase, there's a much bigger story unfolding in the wings.\nWhile the portents are still in their infancy, the budget in May is shaping up as a big deal.\nIt might even address what many of Labor's internal and external supporters have been calling for: a bold future-shaping agenda.\nBefore we get to that, however, there was understandably a great deal of attention in Canberra devoted this week to the former Coalition's ongoing valley of political death and irrelevance.\nThe telenovela headlines were compelling, but much of the detail of the internal jousting and speculation is crushingly tedious.\nSussan Ley survived the week. Perhaps she'll be gone in the coming days. Or by April, or by the time of the budget. Or none of the above.\nAlso, the Coalition is dead. Or not. It all depends who you speak to.\nWhatever the outcome, one senses — and the polls back this up — that most former Coalition voters have tuned out. Send us a memo when you've got your act together.\nA rate hike\nIn the meantime, the only hit on the government came via this week's Reserve Bank course-reversal.\nAfter three rate cuts in 2025, a rebound in inflation pressures has forced the central bank into a hike, with more potentially to come.\nThis is very awkward for the RBA, which prides itself on calling the turning points in the economy and avoiding zig-zags in monetary policy for fear of eroding its credibility.\nBut it was the government that was caught on the backfoot as the opposition prosecuted the argument that public spending is to blame for making the economy too hot.\nWhat ensued was a classic parliamentary insider's parlour game of whether the bank's governor would pick a side in this debate.\nThe most Michelle Bullock would acknowledge — after hours of parliamentary committee testimony on Friday — is that government outlays are part of total spending and \"aggregate demand\" in the economy.\n\"So to the extent that aggregate demand is above aggregate supply, which we think it is, that's contributing to inflation,\" she said on Friday in response to questions at a hearing of the House of Representatives economics committee.\nIt's worth remembering that the bank includes high-levels of state and territory spending in its assessment.\nA problem for Chalmers\nThe problem for the treasurer is that earlier in the week after the central bank hiked the cash rate, he insisted government spending was \"not a factor\" in the bank's decision.\nThe federal government has a variety of options available if it wants to do more to stave off inflation, but none are popular.\nIn his favour, the RBA's decision statement made no mention of government spending while noting that private demand \"has strengthened substantially more than expected\".\nThat the treasurer found himself arguing the toss on this point is partly because the LNP's Ted O'Brien has successfully dragged him into an alleyway political brawl on the topic.\nIt's not an argument either man can afford to lose.\nBut for households soberly calculating the consequences of this week's rate hike, the back-and-forth over whether Bullock had backed a side is secondary.\nAnd their annoyance will depend on what happens next.\nThe surprise in all of this is that the government hasn't mounted a more forceful narrative about the economy that it's seeking to create.\nLoading...\nLabor is mid-way through a generational overhaul of the way Australia invests, hires and produces. Government is inevitably taking up a bigger role.\nNot everyone will like what they're doing, but the scale and scope is breathtaking. It's a story the government could defend without shame.\nThe revolution covers a rapid expansion of the so-called \"care economy\" across childcare, health, the aging and disabilities. These are huge employment realms that stand a greater chance than many other sectors of resisting the feared coming AI threat to traditional work.\nAlong with infrastructure spending in every major city — and much in the regions — there's rising state-funded housing investment, and the return of industrial policy on steroids, with support on the table for everything from heavy industry to critical minerals.\nDefence is ramping up and then add the near-complete rewiring of the energy grid which has already transformed millions of houses and businesses into renewable energy power plants.\nBy the way, have critics of the transition noticed that the recent heatwaves came and went without any of the rolling blackouts and disruptions of the past? It's as if this renewables caper might have an upside.\nSo yes, interest rates are not going down — and government spending is part of the reason — but wages are rising, income taxes have been trimmed, and unemployment is near historic lows.\nLoading\nHardly the end of the world\nWith that level of investment, change and demand in the system is it any surprise the motor is running a little warm?\nIt's kind of what you'd expect. And hardly the end of the world.\nObviously one solution that might help avoid overuse of interest rate pressure would be to boost lousy productivity growth.\n\"The focus from here should be on lifting the capacity of the economy and its run rate,\" says Deloitte Access economist Pradeep Philip.\nWhich is where the government's second-term agenda comes in.\nIf recent history is any guide, the outlines of what this will involve are already there in full view, courtesy of the ACTU.\nThe peak union body should probably win an award as the nation's most successful advocacy group given its hit rate in the Albanese government's first term.\nThe list of wins was substantial, but at the top was industrial relations reform. Sally McManus got pretty much everything she asked for.\nSo what is she and the ACTU pushing for now?\nIn a submission to the treasurer's productivity roundtable in August, it called for a 25 per cent export tax on gas, which it said would raise $17 billion. It also wants to cap the fuel tax credit scheme to end billions of dollars in off-road diesel rebate for resources companies.\nAnd in the wake of the May 2025 election, McManus indicated to Insiders host David Speers that negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount are at the top of the ACTU's reform push.\nThere's no question Cabinet is now in the process of working through all of those issues, and there's a political tailwind in the government's favour, particularly on distortionary property investor incentives.\nFor one thing, the Liberal Party is increasingly isolated in its opposition to the government's brewing plan to remove or reduce the 50 per cent discount to capital gains tax (CGT) for property investors.\nA raft of prominent private sector and academic economists and policy gurus — from Chris Richardson to former Treasury secretary Ken Henry — are calling for changes to a system that was introduced by the Howard government in 1999 to spur share market investment.\nAs policy, it's increasingly seen as a failure.\nA $23bn tax concession\nNSW Treasury has just told a Liberal party-sponsored Senate inquiry currently studying the CGT discount that it has driven up house prices, worsened affordability and reduced home ownership rates.\n\"Furthermore, the benefits of the CGT discount are highly concentrated among higher-income individuals and are amplified through investment structures such as trusts, reinforcing wealth inequality,\" the department said in its submission.\nA tax concession currently running $23 billion a year, money the Commonwealth doesn't collect, operates as an \"annual 'injection' of Commonwealth funds into housing demand, increasing purchasing power for investors and placing upward pressure on prices', it said.\nThe distortion is evident in bank lending numbers, the NSW Treasury analysis argues.\nBefore the CGT discount was introduced more than a quarter of a century ago, lending to investors was about the same as lending to first home buyers, at about $13 billion and $10 billion respectively.\nBy last September, investor lending had reached $139 billion, a 1001 per cent increase, while first time buyer lending had risen by around half that to $64 billion.\nLabor has not ruled out changes to the capital gains tax discount but wants any tax changes to improve housing affordability.\nMore broadly, the Albanese government has the backing of the Greens, teals and other independents in both houses, which would make the Liberal party's resistance legislatively irrelevant should the government take this path.\nSome of the most economically influential voices have also lent their support.\nThe Australian Financial Review's editorial on Friday said winding back \"middle-class welfare for older people\" would help address \"younger people's housing affordability grievances\" and should be seriously considered.\nAnd while there will be an inevitable scare-campaign from some quarters, the politics suggests rich pickings for the government.\nMillennials and younger voters will be on board with bells on, as will some among older generations.\nAssumptions that Baby Boomers, who have benefited from the current system the most, would be opposed to ditching the CGT discount may be misplaced.\nLoading...\nWinning the big arguments\nOne independent who represents one of the nation's wealthiest seats told this column during the week that boomers are very worried about the fact their grandchildren won't be living in their neighbourhood.\nWhen Labor last proposed the idea in the 2019 election, some of the biggest pro-Labor swings were in the nation's wealthiest electorates, including those where the Teals subsequently relieved the Liberal Party of its inner-city political crown jewels.\nThose same teals and independents would be delighted if the Liberal party fights the changes.\nAs do the sharper heads in the government.\nLike 2024's revamp of the stage three tax cuts, this has wedge politics written all over the tin.\nThe government has largely delivered on its 2025 election agenda with environmental law reform and student debt relief among many others.\nIts attention is now swinging to the meat of this term's agenda and the next election.\nMcManus told Speers last year, housing prices have gone up twice the rate of wages over the last 25 years.\nWithout changes to the tax system \"we are just abandoning those generations\", she said.\nShe's become used to winning the big arguments.\nJacob Greber is political editor of ABC's 7.30

interest rates have remained stable in recent weeks. HannamariaH/Getty Images\nThis February could be a smart time for homebuyers and owners hoping to refinance to explore their mortgage rate options. For starters, there's no Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for this month to impact the mortgage rate climate one way or another. Unemployment data, which can have an impact, is also delayed. And inflation, while still sticky, has remained stable in recent months. So stability here can translate into stability in the mortgage rate environment, which is welcome after the stark ups and downs this space has experienced since the start of the decade.\nThe good news is that mortgage interest rates, overall, declined in 2025, and they've stayed near that 2022 level for the opening weeks of 2026, too. So rates here may already be low enough to justify acting, and this February, they're unlikely to change so dramatically that it's worth delaying an application. So, what are today's mortgage interest rates as of February 9, 2026? That's what we'll detail below.\nSee how low your current mortgage rate offers are here.\nWhat are today's mortgage interest rates?\nThe average mortgage interest rate on a 30-year mortgage as of February 9, 2026, is 5.99%, according to Zillow, precisely where it has sat for much of the last month. The average mortgage interest rate on a 15-year mortgage is now 5.37%, also approximately what it has been for much of 2026. While these are not as low as what would have been offered a few years ago, they're still competitive and in line with historic averages.\nBut with rates here largely unmoved in recent weeks, buyers should use this stability to thoroughly shop for rates and lenders online now. With little to impact the rate climate currently, buyers may be able to establish a more accurate baseline by shopping around now, versus waiting for the economy to evolve again in the months to come.\nShop for low mortgage rates online today.\nWhat are today's mortgage refinance rates?\nThe average mortgage refinance rate on a 30-year term is 6.80% as of February 9, 2026, based on Zillow data. The average mortgage refi rate on a 15-year alternative is now 5.52%, which is a bit lower than it had been earlier in the month.\nAnd while the 30-year refinance rate may only be applicable to a small number of current homeowners, the 15-year option can be worth exploring for those who have minimal home balances or want to reduce their payoff timeline. While condensing your mortgage term may result in larger monthly payments, the interest savings and the ability to become debt-free much sooner could be worthy trade-offs.\nThe bottom line\nThe average mortgage interest rate on a 30-year mortgage as of February 9, 2026, is 5.99% and just 5.37% for 15-year options. The average mortgage refinance rate on a 30-year term is currently 6.80% and 5.52% for 15-year options.

You may even be pleasantly surprised at what's available. For months now, there have been multiple mortgage interest rate options listed under 6%. And with the right lender and strategy, qualified buyers may be able to lock in rates closer to 5% now.\nBut it's not just buyers who may be able to benefit from today's cooler interest rate environment. Refinance rates are also down now, opening new windows of opportunity for owners saddled with rates over 7% or higher.

These are just averages, however, and homeowners who take the time to shop around may be able to find noticeably lower rates.\nRemember, you don't need to automatically use the lender who currently has your mortgage, and, in some cases, you shouldn't. Instead, look to see what rates and terms competitors are offering and then return to your original lender with those in hand to see if they can offer you something that's better.\nThe bottom line\nThe average mortgage interest rate on a 30-year term is 5.99% as of February 10, 2026, and it's just 5.37% for buyers who want a 15-year term.

Today, they reiterated that message against a backdrop of a softening economy, stable inflation, and lacklustre labour market. Should the economy perform as expected, we can expect rates to stay put for the time being.\nThat’s a considerable caveat, though: the January rate announcement is rife with the risks posed to our economy, including growing geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade pressure from south of the border.\n“US trade restrictions and uncertainty continue to disrupt growth in Canada. After a strong third quarter, GDP growth in the fourth quarter likely stalled,” writes the Bank in the press release accompanying the rate announcement.\nWhether or not CUSMA is successfully renegotiated this year between Canada, Mexico, and an increasingly confrontational United States is also a keen point of focus for the Bank—should that fall through, a much wider swath of Canadian goods would be subjected to American import tariffs, presenting fresh upheaval for the economy.\nThe central bank has also made clear that should the economy need it, it’s awaiting on the sidelines with a few stockpiled rate cuts.\n“… uncertainty is heightened and we are monitoring risks closely,” the Bank’s Governing Council members add. “If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. The Bank is committed to ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval.”\nStable inflation also supports continued rate hold\nIn addition to a tepid growth forecast—the Bank calls for the economy to improve by 1.1% this year, and 1.5% in 2027—stabilizing inflation has also given the central bank room to take a beat on rates.\nInflation is a key indicator for the Bank’s rate policy; it is part of its mandate to use its trend-setting interest rate to keep its growth within a 2% target. When inflation surpasses this threshold, the Bank responds by increasing its rate, which in turn dissuades consumer spending and investment, theoretically cooling prices. The opposite happens when inflation lags 2%. This is an indicator of a struggling economy that needs stimulus to keep spending activity moving.\nThe most recent December inflation numbers revealed a year-over-year increase in the headline number at 2.4% (from 2.2% in November). On its head, you’d think this would signal the need to hike rates, but looking deeper at the core measures—which are the bank’s preferred metrics—overall price growth is broadly cooling. Should this continue, the Bank could be in a position to actually cut, rather than increase rates, down the line, and further support the current rate hold.\nWhat the BoC’s rate hold means if you’re a mortgage borrower\nThose most impacted by the Bank’s rate decisions are variable-rate mortgage holders, as variable rates are priced based on a plus or minus percentage to a lender’s prime rate, which moves in line with the Bank’s overnight lending rate.\nThis rate hold means zero movement for those with variable-rate mortgages; their interest rate, monthly payment size, or portion of payment servicing interest will change. However, those shopping for a variable may want to move sooner rather than later—now that we’re in a longer-term holding pattern, lenders may opt to change their rates’ spread to prime. This is a tactic that preserves their margins, but whittles your savings. If you’re already at a variable rate, your spread won’t change, but new clients will be impacted. Currently, the lowest five-year variable mortgage rate in Canada is 3.35%—a low not seen since the summer of 2022.\nFixed rates, meanwhile, are stagnant. This is because the five-year Government of Canada bond yield, which lenders use when setting the price floor for fixed-rate mortgages, hasn’t really budged since December, remaining in the 2.8% range. This is partially because the yield for the US 10-year Treasury—considered the global benchmark—has also been elevated in recent weeks. As the US trade, geopolitical, and domestic narratives become increasingly erratic, investors have been less inclined to park their cash in American debt, pivoting instead to assets such as gold.\nUntil this shifts, borrowers can expect yields to stay higher for longer—and little movement among fixed rates. The good news? Today’s best five-year fixed mortgage rate is priced fairly closely to variable, at 3.84%. That’s not a wide spread for anyone looking to lock in at a decent deal.\nWhile a central bank rate hold means fewer discounts for mortgage borrowers, it’s not bad news for savers and passive investors; both high-interest savings accounts (HISAs) and guaranteed income certificates (GICs) are based on their lenders’ prime rates, meaning their rate of return fluctuates alongside the BoC’s movements.\nA rate hold means no change to the interest earned by these accounts and investments—and peace of mind for savers.","wordCount":812},"cachedAt":1770820466024},"https://financialpost.com/news/economy/small-growing-case-lower-interest-rates-royce-mendes":{"data":{"author":"Larysa Harapyn","date":"Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:11:12 GMT","siteName":"Financial Post","imageUrl":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no0128bocJPG.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1128&h=846&type=webp&sig=OrJEq4VCmaMOgSVzWi_7Gg","text":"Royce Mendes, managing director and head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, talks to Financial Post’s Larysa Harapyn about how the Bank of Canada made the right call by holding its interest rate and signalling that it was monitoring risks to the economy.","wordCount":43},"cachedAt":1770820466096},"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/38128040/bank-of-england-interest-rate-decision-inflation-your-money/":{"data":{"siteName":"thesun.co.uk","imageUrl":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/icon-e1459786005667.png?strip=all","text":"Attention,\nOur system has indicated that your user behaviour is potentially automated.\nNews Group Newspapers Limited does not permit the access, collection, text or data mining of any content from our Service by any automated means whether directly or through an intermediary service.

Its last rate cut occurred in August.\nThis is the RBA's first monetary policy meeting of 2026.\nTreasurer says it will be 'difficult news' for households\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the rate rise would be \"difficult news for millions of Australians with a mortgage\" and the government understood the pressure it would put on people.\nThe Albanese government's political opponents, and several media outlets, have put a lot of pressure on the government over the summer break about the concerning pick-up in inflation in the back half of 2025.\nChalmers has pointed out that the RBA Board's statement does not mention government spending.\n\"It makes it very clear the pressure on inflation is coming from private demand,\" he said.\nThe great unspoken truth about central banking and monetary policy is that while it's aimed at consumer prices, its most direct impact is on house prices, which are arguably the most important prices of all.\nThe RBA also released its new official forecasts on Tuesday, in its latest quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy.\nIt is now forecasting consumer price index (CPI) inflation to peak at 4.2 per cent in the middle of this year, up from 3.7 per cent in its November forecasts.\nIt is forecasting \"trimmed mean\" inflation (its preferred measure of underlying inflation) to peak at 3.7 per cent in the middle of this year, up from its previous forecast of 3.2 per cent.\nThe RBA wants inflation to be sitting around 2.5 per cent.\nIt is also forecasting economic growth to be stronger than expected at the start of this year, but weaker than expected by the middle of next year.\n\"The near-term upward revision is driven by private demand, which looks to have been stronger than expected in the second half of 2025 due to both fundamental factors supporting growth as well as some temporary factors,\" the RBA said in its new forecasts.\n\"We expect that some of this unanticipated strength in private demand will continue into 2026.\n\"From late 2026 onwards, GDP growth is expected to ease to below potential, reflecting the higher cash rate path and the waning boost from the factors that have supported growth recently.\n\"The unemployment rate is expected to be broadly stable in the near term, before rising gradually to 4.6 per cent by mid-2028 because of a period of GDP growing below its potential rate,\" it said.\nEconomists expect more rate rises\nSeveral economists are now tipping the RBA to lift rates again this year.\nSome say the RBA Board's statement had a noticeably \"hawkish\" tone, which suggests that Australia may be at the start of a new rate-hiking cycle.\nBut in her post-meeting press conference, RBA governor Michele Bullock did not seem particularly hawkish.\nWee Khoon Chong, APAC Macro Strategist at BNY, said the RBA would probably hike rates by another 0.25 percentage points this year.\nInflation rose at the end of 2025, picking up more than forecast, adding to rate hike expectations.\nAbhijit Surya from Capital Economics said another rate hike was likely, and a third could be a possibility.\nCallam Pickering, APAC economist at global job site Indeed, said it was unlikely that the RBA would hike rates only once, and he expected another hike in May.\n\"A lengthy hiking cycle, though, appears unlikely, with inflation set to moderate somewhat even without RBA action,\" he said.\nDavid Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares, said he was currently not expecting another rate hike.\n\"Much will depend on the degree to which temporary versus demand-led factors account for the recent pick-up in inflation,\" he said.\n\"If it turns out that temporary factors have played a greater role than the RBA currently assesses, inflation may drop by more than the RBA expects in coming months, and this may well be a case of 'one and done'.\n\"This is currently my base case expectation, namely, a greater slowing in underlying inflation in the March quarter, removing the pressure on the RBA to raise rates in May.\n\"However, at this stage, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the RBA has in mind at least one more rate hike — consistent with current market pricing — because even under this scenario inflation is expected to remain uncomfortably high for the foreseeable future,\" he said.","wordCount":922},"cachedAt":1770820466436},"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-03/if-rba-hikes-interest-rates-you-cant-say-it-didnt-warn-us/106295546":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820469070},"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/shorts/federal-reserve-decides-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-256756805651":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820469071},"https://www.semafor.com/article/01/28/2026/fed-holds-interest-rates-steady":{"data":{"author":"J.D.

Commercial real estate industry reaction to the hold was somewhat mixed, while leading economists said they were not surprised but that Macklem’s comments showed the BoC’s concerns about economic uncertainty and Canada-U.S. trade tensions.\n“Today’s decision is not a surprise, in light of inflation ticking upward,” said Mark Fieder, head of Avison Young’s Canadian business. “I anticipate we will see a continued hold on the overnight rate for the foreseeable future, taking us toward the later part of 2026.”\nThe CRE sector will clearly benefit when the BoC decides to introduce cuts again, he added.\n“Canadian bonds are expected to experience more stability in 2026, coming out of a volatile 2025 – particularly the Government of Canada’s five-year bond, which drives lenders’ decisions around setting fixed mortgage rates,” he said. “With uncertainty still in play around trade policies, we remain keenly focused on how economic indicators influence the Bank of Canada’s decisions. Our 2026 outlook for commercial real estate, as revealed in a recent poll of Avison Young experts, remains quite positive.”\nMichael Constantino, CEO of Webull Canada, said the hold signals a fundamental shift from monetary stimulus to strategic pause.\n“After aggressive easing throughout 2025, policymakers now view rates as appropriately calibrated,” he said. “It reflects deep uncertainty around U.S. trade policy and CUSMA renegotiation at a time when Canadian business sentiment remains fragile. For investors, this creates a more complex environment than the straightforward tailwinds of last year’s rate cuts.\n“The pause removes a key driver that powered financials and rate-sensitive sectors higher, while persistent trade uncertainty keeps volatility elevated across export-heavy industrials and materials.”\nPrime Minister Mark Carney’s government continues to negotiate a new version of CUSMA with little sign of progress.\n“Bottom line is, we agreed that the current policy rate is appropriate if the economy evolves broadly in line with the outlook we just published,” BoC Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters in Ottawa.\nBoC leaders reached a consensus that it’s very difficult to predict either the direction or timing of the next move in the central bank’s policy rate, he added.\nAs expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve also held its key rate again Wednesday. In rare comments about the Fed, Macklem said the threat to the U.S. central bank’s independence has contributed to the Canadian economic uncertainty.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has voiced numerous complaints about Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May. Many questions have been raised about the Fed’s future independence as Trump prepares to appoint a new Fed leader amid his ongoing anger with its rate decisions.\n“Look, why did I make a point of commenting on Chairman Powell and the U.S. Fed?” The simple reason is the U.S. Federal Reserve is the biggest and most important central bank in the world,” said Macklem. “And, we all need it to work well. A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all, and for Canada, our financial markets are particularly integrated with the United States, so it would particularly affect us.\n“It’s hard to predict exactly what this would look like, but keeping the Fed operating independently, it’s good for Americans, it’s good for Canadians.”\nCentral banks’ independence give them the space to take difficult decisions that benefit a country’s economy and citizens over the medium term, he added.\nMacklem said heightened geopolitical risks and unpredictable U.S. policy, with threats to Canada and other countries, have addded to the Canadian economic uncertainty.\n“We are monitoring those risks very closely, and if a new shock comes along, or an accumulation of evidence that materially changes our outlook, we’re prepared to respond,” he said.\nPictured: Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem\nPhoto: University of Toronto","wordCount":659},"cachedAt":1770820470221},"https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/federal-reserve-decides-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-256751685525":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820473076},"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/28/nx-s1-5690136/federal-reserve-interest-rates-jobs-labor-inflation":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820473077},"https://globalnews.ca/news/11641753/federal-reserve-rate-announcement-january-2026/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820473077},"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/4436660/watch-live-jerome-powell-delivers-interest-rate-decision-first-public-event-since-doj-inquiry/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820477078},"https://blog.remax.ca/bank-of-canada-makes-latest-interest-rate-announcement/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820477079},"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/feb/10/trumps-plan-peace-gaza-board-peace/":{"data":null,"cachedAt":1770820707335}}
