Although it was challenging to secure a reservation, I eventually managed to book a table for Sunday at 9:45 p.m. a month in advance. Their specialty dish, the Steak au Poivre, was satisfactory considering the price. However, I highly recommend the crab beignets as an appetizer.

We are set up with our same waitress. We had early this year, Aimee, who is hands-down with the best personalities and waitresses we’ve had in New York. She remembered me because no one else ever orders the cocktail the Paper Plane. We went with the classics again and got the stick off of a burger up above with the artichoke vinaigrette. All hands down one of the best steaks, the best burgers any of us have had in a long time. Thanks Amy for the recommendation to head to Pete’s Tavern afterwards for the full Christmas bar feel.",

It's not bad by any means, but I am pretty disappointed especially since the food looks better than it actually tastes (not bad, just very average).\n\nRazor clams: Tangy, slightly savory, but you should prob pass on it at $7/pp.\n\nBurrata Crostini: it looks amazing, but there was no flavor. I literally only tasted the crostini.\n\nFarro Salad: Nice composition of flavors, but it doesn't really stand out.\n\nTuscan Fried Chicken: Fairly flavorful and juicy, the best of the appetizers. But honestly, you are much better off going to a restaurant dedicated to fried chicken.\n\nFrench Fries: Actually really good, crispy and salty. If I ever came back, I would always order these with my meal.\n\nChicken Milanese: ....the little side salad and the jam was the best part. The crust is the milanese is crispy and salted well, the chicken itself is cooked well..... But the chicken itself was not seasoned.\n\nThe portions were okay overall.\n\nI'm not a picky eater by any means, but I was pretty disappointed overall with this meal. Maybe I was there the wrong day, but I left fairly disappointed. Although I rated it a 4 overall by NY standards, I would personally consider the food a 3/5 as I doubt I would ever return myself.",

The arancini was crunchy with good flavor but it was served cold, which we didn’t like. Chicken Milanese parmesan was huge and tasty enough. Pasta cacio e pepe was decent.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the dessert. The pear galette had a super salty crust that was challenging to eat, perhaps it should have been an appetizer. The meringue-ata cake had a weird texture and was basically inedible. It felt like biting into butter, not in a good way.\n\nI am glad I tried the restaurant but don’t think I will go back.",

Superb food, attentive but never intrusive friendly service, warm atmosphere, inventive delicious cocktails, and approachable and thoughtful wine list. The sommelier was also warm and friendly and is clearly passionate as well as knowledgeable about wine and he took his time to explain the history of each wine he recommended and what makes it so special and how it pairs with each plate (many of which we have not seen anywhere else). The Caio e Pepe is the best we have ever had and beats any version of this dish we have had in Rome. How they prepare a basically three-ingredient dish so beautifully is nothing short of magic. The same applies to the other dishes on the menu that we have tried. Simple, fresh ingredients that Italy is famous for, prepared beautifully with just the right balance to enhance the flavors both individually and as a whole.  Altro Paradiso makes the whole experience seem effortless,  and we always leave feeling happy and taken care of, looking forward to our next visit.  Delizioso!",

The jambon beurre with their sourdough bread is amazing, as well as their pasties like the lemon mascarpone sphere. The avocado toast with smoked salmon is good, but portion are on the smaller side. Their matcha latte surprisingly is very good, and you get a HUGE cup for the price. The service is sometimes a little disorganized, but always friendly. Beware: on weekends, they will want the table back after you finish eating because of the flow of people, don’t recommend to try and read / linger there on those days.",

I’ll lead with the pros and minor misses -\n\nPros -\nUni bucatini was delectable, creamy, flavorful, the pasta was al dente and the red chilies cut through the richness occasionally so it was so easy to keep enjoying the dish\n\nThe spicy tuna crispy rice was delicious. I love their little twist on the classic crispy rice that adds to the texture. Cant ever knock a crispy rice but this was definitely a memorable one!\n\nCrispy rock shrimp was addicting and crunchy. The batter was light and the shrimp were fresh and great!\n\nMinor misses -\nThe seafood tower was a considerable let down. Aside from the shrimp, the oysters and clams were unpleasantly fishy and sandy. The seafood salad was also bland and chewy in a very unpleasant way. Though this is one minor miss, I would anticipate a seafood oriented restaurant to perfect their seafood towers\n\nOverall it’s a nice establishment. The interior design is unique and well thought out, mimicking the interior of a boat.",

I would and could eat it regularly if I live nearby. I appreciate that the menu is small because then you know the food was well-thought of and quality/ taste will be amazing.  Too bad the space is so tiny that it can make moving and eating difficult. I think some of the dishes came from next door and had to be brought in from outside.",

We were lucky to have Daniela as our server, and she truly made the evening special—warm, attentive, and genuinely kind throughout the meal.\n\nThe beef bourguignon was absolutely amazing: rich, deeply flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The salmon was also very good and well-prepared. Unfortunately, the lobster pasta fell short of expectations—it was quite bland and not worth the price point, especially compared to the other dishes.\n\nThe drink menu deserves special praise. They offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails, and both were excellent—creative, balanced, and clearly crafted with care.\n\nLastly, the view elevated the entire experience. We sat upstairs, yes the tables were really squished in so my back was almost right against the person behind me, but the setting was really beautiful, adding a sense of elegance and charm to the meal. Overall, La Grande Boucherie is a wonderful spot with great service, memorable food highlights, and a stunning atmosphere, even if one dish missed the mark.",

During the holiday season, the décor and ambiance are especially stunning and add to the overall experience. Reservations can be tricky to secure, so planning ahead is a must—using OpenTable alerts really helps. I was able to dine indoors, but even the atrium felt comfortable and cozy despite the cold weather outside. The food was exceptional across the board, with rich flavors and beautiful preparation. The steak sandwich, in particular, completely stole the show. Everything about this visit was memorable and well worth it.",

We were seated on the second floor, which was a little tight, but I enjoyed it. It was like a little nook, and we could look over the railing towards the first floor/outdoor section below us and people watch. My sisters ordered the French Onion soup for starters, which they enjoyed. I ordered the filet with the bordelaise sauce. The meat was very tender but not as savory as I hoped. My sister ordered the bouef bourguignon and had mixed feelings. We were eager to try dessert but were rushing to see a show. Our waitress was very accommodating and rushed our dessert order for us. We ordered the creme brûlée, and it was fantastic! We were in a rush, so I'm missing a picture of our dessert, sadly. I will say this place is definitely a pretty penny, even the water and soda they charge per bottle. But overall, we had a wonderful time!",

It is surprising, as pasta in general is not a difficult dish to make, at least to make it average level. The pricing is pricey, but that comes with the location, I guess. Not sure what the problem is here - perhaps too much is pre-prepared? Nevertheless, it is definitely not a place I'd return to.\n\nAbsolutely no complaints about the staff, who is friendly and attentive.",

However, the high price tag, especially for the wine and drinks, felt a bit steep.\n\nConsidering the location, some premium is expected, but just a few blocks away, there are spots offering more authentic and value-packed Italian experiences.\n\nA fair choice if you're nearby, but there's more to explore in the area for Italian cuisine enthusiasts. 🍝🍷📍",

The ambience is warm and welcoming, and you’re attended by Italian servers, which adds an authentic touch to the experience.\n\nWe started with bruschettas topped with prosciutto, which were excellent—simple yet full of flavor. They also brought fresh bread with olive oil to the table, a nice classic touch. For the main dishes, we tried a few different pastas. The truffle fettuccini was good, but honestly, the truffle flavor wasn’t as strong or rich as we had hoped. The carbonara, on the other hand, was excellent—creamy, flavorful, and definitely the highlight of the meal. The tagliatelle with marinara sauce was fine, though nothing particularly special.\n\nOne thing to note is that the restaurant does not accept credit cards, which is quite unusual and a bit inconvenient. On top of that, an automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill, which I personally did not like, as I prefer to decide the tip myself based on the service.\n\nOverall, Bar Pitti has great vibes, attentive service, and some solid dishes—especially the carbonara. But the payment policy and the mandatory gratuity are definitely something to keep in mind before going.",

Have to mention how kind the barista was, we didn’t realize they opened at 9 - not 8 - he had just gotten in and let us stay and served us still! I was stuck between a few of their cool latte options (beet, tumeric, black mamba) he suggested the black mamba based on someone’s review yesterday and was right - one of the most unique and delicious lattes I’ve had - made with charcole but you can’t tell it’s still so delicious and smooth. We also had an iced coffee, a vegan blueberry muffin (great!) , and the cheddar biscuit (also delicious) so we were very happy with the food and drinks. The space is so cool, very unique decoration pieces and a lot of seating space.\nAll in all highly recommend, and can’t wait to go back to try their wraps and paninis which look great!",

The baristas are genuinely some of the kindest, most welcoming people—you walk in and they remember your usual, always with a smile and zero attitude. The coffee is consistently outstanding: their Lucky Shot espresso pulls are rich and fruity, the iced oat milk lattes are creamy perfection, and the seasonal pour-overs never miss.\nLove that it feels like a real neighborhood cafe—great playlist, plenty of seats, natural light, and that classic Brooklyn vibe without trying too hard. Pastries (especially the vegan blueberry muffin) are always fresh, and the prices are totally fair for the quality.\nWhether I’m grabbing a quick cold brew on my way to the L train or camping out with my laptop for a couple hours, it’s always a good experience. Huge thanks to the whole crew for making mornings better. Williamsburg is lucky to have you! ☕❤️",

From appetizers to main course to dessert, everything was exquisit and perfectly prepared!  The atmosphere was enchanting.  The chef, Doug Brixton, came out to talk with us about our food, he is definately an expert in his field!  His staff was wonderful and accomodating! I dont get to NYC often, but will definately eat here again and highly recommend the Golden Swan to those who want to enjoy an evening of fine dining in the heart of NYC",

There is even a special area on the top level that for up to 12 guests for special occasions. The food is unreal and has so much detail put in the the flavors of each entree. From the appetizers to the dessert they are something we will never forget and will come in town to come back to eat again. The chef has done a fabulous job with the menu and the ambience of the entire experience.",

I wish I discovered this gem of a restaurant sooner. The vibe is of a comfy cozy neighborhood restaurant. We enjoyed the French onion soup, meatball sliders and the Bibb and Beets salad. The salad was absolutely delicious and worth coming back for that dish alone. I enjoyed my non-alcoholic drink but found the desserts a tad too sweet for my taste. The service was excellent. Jorge was especially hospitable and made us feel welcomed. I will be back soon.",

A very unique yet simple way of cooking the fish. The story goes that it used to be grilled until the grill went out in the first week and they’ve decided to broil ever since. They really go over and above to make sure you’re comfortable as well. It was very nice to feel well taken care of.",

                "text": "Tartine – Our Forever Favorite in the West Village\n\nSome places feed you more than food—and Tartine is one of those rare, irreplaceable spots.\n\nTucked into the dreamiest little corner of the West Village, Tartine is where my husband and I had our very first date night. It’s where he took me for my first birthday after we met. And later, it’s where we shot part of our wedding photos. Even my husband’s colleagues gifted us wedding anniversary gift card from Tartine ! That’s how personal this place is to us.\n\nWe’ve been back more times than I can count, and it’s never just about the food (though the food is always good). It’s about the energy, the people, the warmth. The staff are some of the kindest you’ll meet in New York—no pretense, just genuine hospitality. Even though they don’t take reservations, you never feel rushed or forgotten. People wait patiently, because everyone seems to know: it’s worth it.\n\nThe food? Honest. Generous. Comforting. There’s nothing overly fussy—just really well-made dishes that feel like home. My go-to is the crab cake when it’s available (an underrated gem), and if you’re lucky, the white frosted cheesecake will be on the menu—soft, light, and absolutely dreamy. My husband swears by the burger. The menu changes often enough to keep things exciting, but the soul of it stays the same.\n\nIn summer, Tartine is extra magical. The leafy West Village corner, the big windows, the sunlight filtering in—it’s the kind of spot you want to sit at for hours with someone you love. But even on a rainy or gloomy day, something about it lifts your mood. It just feels good to be there.\n\nTartine may not be flashy or trendy, but that’s exactly why we love it. It’s one of those truly underrated places that deserves to be cherished—and we’ll keep coming back, again and again💗💗💗",

                "text": "We enjoyed a rather luxurious meal at Boucherie; the service was quick and friendly and the quality of food was great. We visited this restaurant for our first night in NYC as I heard they went all out with Christmas decorations and that the atmosphere would be unmatched. Upon entering the restaurant, we were met with an incredibly bustling environment with not a single empty seat. The Christmas decorations were lovely and the space was packed with holiday spirit. I feel like the tables could not have been more close together; they were really making use of all of the available floor space they had.\n\nWe were seated at a nice table on the second floor, which was not the most spacious, however still nice. Some of the seats at the 4-person table overlooked the ground floor and provided such a beautiful view. Onto the food, our waitress was very helpful and assured me that they could get me something different if I didn't like what I was served. I ordered the confit de canard and my two friends ordered the steak frites. Although pricey for sure, the steak frites lived up to our expectations, as it was delicious and cooked to our liking. The duck leg, however, was a little disappointing as a lot of the meat was dry, as if it was left in the oven for too long. Consequently, it was hard to bite and felt dry. I don't think it was worth the $44USD. Finally, we were quite appalled by the price of one glass of coke --- my friend ordered a glass and got a refill because the glass was mostly filled with ice, and it ultimately ran us up $18!!!! That was pretty insane but I guess it's a fancier restaurant, so we should be more cautious next time.\n\nAll in all, we had an enjoyable experience dining at Boucherie and it lived up to our expectations. If you're willing to spend a pretty penny for decent food and a wonderful atmosphere, definitely check it out!",

The service is impeccable, the cocktails are thoughtfully crafted, and the food is both high quality and delicious. We ordered the oysters, the Frog Legs Kiev, and the steak dinner for two. Every dish was exceptional, with the Frog Legs Kiev being my personal favorite. I would highly recommend Wild Cherry to anyone who appreciates excellent food, a sense of theatre, and a genuinely fun night out.",

The curved ceiling and thin walls amplified sound, making it difficult to hear the one you were dining with.\n\nService was fine, attentive, but not at the level you’d expect from the people behind Frenchette and Le Veau d’or. It was clear it was all hands on deck, but that left the bathroom a mess and missed opportunities for real hospitality.\n\nThe food was priced somewhat high for what it was — it lacked the richness French cuisine should have but the menu items did have the nostalgic comfort diner food brings. The Alfredo and rice and beans were charming!\n\nWhat they did do right was the martini, but you can find many a good martini in Manhattan and with more intimate atmosphere and hospitable service.",

Both hostess and the First Gentleman I spoke to Nicolas were very kind and helpful! I had to run in and out because I work but I had the coconut cake! It was delicious! I was at the bar though and I didn’t try the food but if I get another reservation I most definitely will try the menu!\n\nGet loud though but it was party to the side of me liquor glasses all over the table..so there’s that. However, it was a nice little date for me to me and will be back especially for that cake.\n\nThank you!!\n\nLeandra",

The linguine was buttery and delicious.\nFor desserts I wish the sticky toffee pudding was less sweet but it was moist and well made. I was not a fan of profiteroles filled with ice cream as it made it so heavy. I usually like it with pastry cream. Choux pastry was not crispy, not the best. Hot chocolate had a slight malted flavor which was pleasant- right amount of chocolate and sweetness.\n\nService and ambience were excellent.",

Of the food, the sweet potatoes, fried artichokes, and burrata were exceptional. Everything else was pretty bad. My steak, which I ordered rare, was tough and cooked medium well so it was barely edible. My pot of chocolate was very gritty.\n\nMy friends enjoyed the scallops and gnocchi but I didn't enjoy my entree or dessert at all.\n\nGreat attentive service.\n\nThe worst part was how insanely loud the place is with no dampening so it was like being in a noise conversation tunnel all night. Probably the outside seating is better.\n\nOverall, the food and drinks are a bit overpriced for the iffy quality. We spent over $500 for 4 people.",

Where we were seated initially was pretty cramped and we realized fairly quickly it just wasn’t going to be comfortable for us. When we asked if a larger table that wasn’t so close to neighboring tables might be available we were quickly and graciously accommodated without hesitation. We ordered stuffed flatbread, chrysanthemum salad, buffalo milk caramelle, calamari fried rice, sourdough pasta cacciatore, steak limone, and the ravioli for the table to share for dinner. Our party also shared the tiramisu and pear sorbet for dessert. Everything we ate was a home run, not one bite missed, not even a little. Also worth mentioning, every dish was measurably different from the next, Don Angie plays many notes on our palates it seems. The atmosphere is upscale but not uptight.",

We ordered the chrysanthemum salad, calamari w/pepperoni rice, caramelle pasta, and the lasagna to share and everything was beyond expectations. The calamari really surprised us, but the salad is a must order. The lasagna is delicious and the portions are huge. The bread it is served with is amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant as “worth it” if you’re trying to get a reservation: keep trying!",

On days he is not available or on vacation it is an absolute disaster service wise and the food is almost a 2 star rating. Everything is Chewy, pale, horribly cut. When he is available everything is pristine. Buttery, fresh, delicious. Take a look at my depressing 150$ delivery order. My Otoro looks like it’s a phantom of yesterday’s Tuna. Better to close your restaurant on days the head chef isn’t available then keep open and lose clients.",

There are so many different nooks and crannies in this place.

The broth is a thick and creamy concoction of soymilk and white miso that pairs well with the thick udon (thick flat strands like fettucine). The lobster claw is perfectly poached, and the side of nori to garnish adds another layer of umami. The 8-seater around the bar adds to an intimate feel within the beautiful and tranquil setting!",

I know my ramen.\nFor the food, I had the wagyu garlic gyoza and it was fantastic. It taste like a high class burger in a gyoza wrap. Its fantastic. Try it. The sauce was some kind of ponzu sauce. Strong citrus flavor. If you know what calamansi is, that's what will remind you of. Its not overpowering and dip it with th bitterness of the mustard and it's a great compliment to th flavors. Not quite a flavor explosion of grilled wagyu but great none the less.\nThe tonkotsu ramen is worth going back for. Thick tonkotsu broth, chasu that just falls off, noodles that are firm yet melts slightly in your mouth. A fried chopped garlic and chili sauce are great with it as well but I encourage you to take it in as is and have chili little by little by making a little ramen on your spoon. This place is worth it. Go.\nOishi kata.",

The spinach in sesame was a starter I'd go back for again. It is pricey, however the sushi and sashimi are of great quality and are well crafted. The atmosphere is great. Compact and lively.",

                "text": "I came to Blue Ribbon Sushi about two years ago and had an amazing experience — a big sushi platter that cost around $200 and felt well worth it. I recently went back for a quick date night, and while the food was still good, the prices have gotten insanely high. I know inflation is real, but this felt pretty extreme.\n\nWe ordered the crispy rice with spicy tuna, the Hamachi Serrano, two pieces of otoro sushi, the Unadon, plus one basic bottle of hot sake. The total came out to about $180 including tip, which honestly blew my mind given how little food we actually got.\n\nThe otoro sushi especially was disappointing — each piece was around $18, and the slice of fish on top was tiny. It didn’t taste bad, but for that price, I expected something more memorable. Overall, the food was decent but definitely not worth what we paid — and I left still feeling hungry.\n\nOn the positive side, the service was excellent. The staff was super attentive and managed to seat us last minute even though the place was fully booked. The restaurant itself is small, cozy, and great for a date night, but I’d just say be prepared to spend a lot more than you’d expect.\n\nIn short, the food is fine, the vibe is nice, but the prices are over the top for what you get. I wouldn’t recommend it for a casual dinner unless you’re ready to splurge.",

                "text": "I just left Blue Ribbon Sushi NYC completely disappointed — and still hungry. I paid $57 for food that wasn’t worth half of it. The menu is confusing, with no clear prices, and shrimp tempura wasn’t even listed. When it came, it was just four tiny pieces for $18 — bland, forgettable, and definitely not fresh.\n\nBut the worst part was the rude service. I politely asked the waiter if I could charge my phone, and he disappeared. When he finally came back, instead of being helpful, he said, “So, are you ordering more or not?”\nThat attitude alone ruined the experience. No warmth, no hospitality — just a feeling that I was an inconvenience for not ordering fast enough.\n\nI only went there because Sushi Lin across the street doesn’t have a full kitchen at this location — I really wish they did. I would have had a better meal and much better service.\n\nOverall: Overpriced sushi, unfriendly staff, terrible customer service, and poor value.\nIf you’re in NYC and want good sushi, skip Blue Ribbon Sushi — there are far better options nearby that actually care about their customers.",

Despite having a reservation, we were forced to wait 20 minutes while the reception staff treated us with arrogance and dismissal.\nThe dining area is in the basement; it was incredibly loud, stuffy, and poorly ventilated. It felt suffocating rather than high-end.\n\nThe Food:\nWe were a table of four and spent $550, yet left completely unsatisfied. Most hot dishes were oily, heavy on seasoning, or lacked quality.\n\n• Glacier 51 Sea Bass ($56): Supposed to be truffle and miso, but had zero flavor of either.\n• A5 Wagyu New Style: A waste of premium meat. It tasted overwhelmingly of generic soy sauce.\n• Squid Pasta: Essentially just wok-fried vegetables with squid. I’d expect this at a casual Chinese restaurant, not here.\n• Shiitake Salad ($30): Way too oily.\n• Miso Soup ($9): Tasted exactly like instant soup.\n• Salmon Tartare: Heavily over-seasoned and the portion size was pathetic.\n• New Style White Fish: The flavor profile was just weird.\n• Grilled Salmon ($40): Oily and unremarkable.\n• Sushi: The nigiri ($8/piece) was average at best. The Salmon Tacos were too salty, though the Lobster Tacos were passable.\n\nThe Service:\nThe service was as poor as the food. Haha when I left a standard 15% tip, he sneered at me.\n\nIf you are looking for authentic Japanese food or a pleasant environment, go elsewhere. Nobu worldwide seems to be resting on its name rather than quality. Don't go.",

                "text": "Great quality, flavorful, and very well done omakase at a reasonable price. Had the 17 course menu for $100 at lunch time. They also offer a 12 course menu for $65. Both menus offer a good variety of fish and flavor combinations. The courses are definitely more classic and traditional but well done and tasty.\n\nThe interior is small; feels like proper Japan. But it’s a comfortable noise level — some quiet background music, which makes it easy to talk.\n\nThe omakase chefs don’t really explain much about the food — they just name the fish and dish when they serve you. You can see how they prepare everything right in front of you. The pace of the courses are good. Nice attention to detail from the chefs: I’ve been here twice and both times when the chef noticed that I was left-handed, they placed the food at the different side of the plate.\n\nService is attentive and quick.\nThe second time I was here, we were celebrating my sister’s birthday. At the end, they dimmed the lights, switched from their mellow instrumental  background music to 50 Cents - In Da Club playing on high volume, gave my sister a sparkler, and served her another sushi course with a candle, and the entire team danced to the song for about 30 seconds. Best birthday recognition I’ve ever seen from a restaurant staff.",

The way this meal changed my entire mood in a short 90 minute seating. This was some of the best omakase I have had in the city and for the best price I've been able to find. The fish was fresher than could be and every single course was delectable and yummy. I left actually feeling pretty full (which can be tough at omakase experiences sometimes) and throughly enjoyed the entire dining experience. Even though we were the last ones at the bar, they never rushed us and made our time together really special. Would love to bring a big group and take over the entire sushi bar, it was that good!!!",

The interior is decorated with Japanese posters and has private booths for you to enjoy your BBQ at. You order on an iPad and your food is brought out to you soon after. Price for dinner is ~$50, and on Tuesdays it's AYCD hot sake!\n\nWe ordered a variety of meats as well as appetizers and sashimi. The appetizers were pretty solid. I enjoyed their seaweed salad and seafood pancake. Although their takoyaki was good, I felt like it was a bit too oily. The meat was alright. Although they had good sauces and spices to dip it in, I felt like the quality was a bit too tough for me. The sushi/sashimi was good—better than I expected! Our favorite cut of the night actually ended up being the garlic shrimp. I ended my meal with their jelly appetizer/dessert. Wish there were more options for their AYCE package, but overall, not bad!",

The quality of the fish, the precision of the technique, and the absolute calm and confidence of the chefs were extraordinary. I paired the courses with carefully chosen spirits, which complemented the progression of the meal beautifully.\n\nWhat made this experience truly exceptional was how fundamentally it changed my understanding of sushi. After that lunch, I finally understood what top-level sushi is truly meant to be. It became a benchmark against which I have measured every other sushi experience since — and very few have come close. The craftsmanship, restraint, and purity of flavour were simply outstanding.\n\nOne minor drawback was that a couple seated nearby ignored the strict no-photography policy and took photos throughout the meal. Unfortunately, this was not addressed by staff, which slightly disrupted the otherwise disciplined and serene atmosphere.\n\nThat aside, the experience was phenomenal. The price point was undeniably high, but at this level — and based on my experience with three-star restaurants — it felt fully justified. At the time, Masa unquestionably deserved its three Michelin stars.",

This is not the Bar Masa location.  This place down the hall from Bar Masa.  This Masa is next to the another 3 Star Michelin Per Se.  As opposed to the Blue Door at Thomas Kellers spot, Masa has a Blue Curtain signifying the are open and if located outside would provide shade.  After you pass the curtain a Huge Cypress door guards whats inside.  You are quickly acknowledged and locked into your bar height chairs.  And you can put your elbows on the Inviting Hinoki  Counter and you will find a block of ice to keep some ingredients chilled for service.  Unfortunately there is a no photo policy so for my video review I had to tap my artistic side, so I hope you enjoy my youtube review.  It's definitely a bucket list item for most of the world.  I hope you do enjoy my Channel, Noah Eats well!",

                "text": "Sat at the counter. Incredible experience. Favorite dishes were:\n\n1. Taro tartare with caviar. Every restaurant I've been to tries to upselm you caviar at exorbitant prices and then is stingy with it. Here it's just part of the menu and it is an extremely generous portion, and paired with the best cut of tuna.\n\n2. Omi wagyu and truffles. Omi is the best cut of the agyu called the emperors beef because it was saved for the emperor. But the emperor never had truffles on it. What. Surprisingly good combination.\n\n3. The rest was a tasting menu of pieces of sushi and every one was really good.\n\n4. The Japanese melon was special. Sometimes they have a strawberry. Either way it's the same place that gives erewhon their $19 strawberry.\n\nWe skipped lunch to fully enjoy it but it wasn't a crazy amount of food. Felt happily full after. If it's your anniversary or birthday you get some lady M cake at the end, which was great. Otherwise the only dessert is the melon so you can even plan to go have dessert somewhere after if you didn't want to have lady M.\n\nOverall I feel like the innovativeness of the caviar and truffle dishes will be lost on more casual diners but those two make the price tag pretty worth it in my opinion.",

Walking into the secret space and waiting for the curtain to drop felt like the start of a show!\nEvery single dish was delicious. I’m usually a huge Uni lover, but the other courses here were so outstanding that they stole the show. My personal favorite of the night was definitely the Unagi absolutely amazing.\nThe service was truly next-level. Both the manager and the chef were incredibly attentive and observant; they anticipated our needs without being intrusive. As introverts, we really appreciated how they balanced friendly small talk with giving us space. They really knew how to \"read the room\" perfectly.\nA few minor notes: Even though I mentioned it was a birthday celebration, there wasn't a special dessert dish or candle. They did offer a celebratory shot at the end, but since we don't drink alcohol, we missed out on that.\nRegarding drinks, I had read other reviews mentioning a potential push for alcohol orders (since there are no add-on options), but we didn't feel that pressure at all. As soon as we ordered soft drinks, they immediately took the hint and didn't force anything on us, which we appreciated.\nOverall, I highly recommend this spot for a delicious Omakase meal and a unique vibe, rather than strictly for a special \"event.\"",

There are only two seatings a day and 8 seats in the entire restaurant, so a very intimate experience. The chef and staff are chatting with you the whole time and are so knowledgeable and talented. They often research their guests as well — they knew all about my partner's work and running hobby. (I guess I was harder to find info on!)\n\nThe food (as well as sake/wine pairing, which I highly recommend) is SUCH an experience. The best sushi I've had, hands down. Everything is presented so beautifully as well — each new sake and/or wine is brought in a new gorgeous glass.\n\nThis is always at the top of my recommendation list for friends and family seeking the right spot to celebrate a special occasion.",

Ioana was so amazing to work with and helped plan all of the little details for our favors and menu. They were flexible and accommodating. Definitely recommend!\n\n—\n\nBest neighborhood brunch spot! The friendliest staff, best service, and the food is sooo good. Have to get the latkes and the chicken schnitzel. Save room for the bakery items. And the espresso martini is delicious.",

                "text": "Visited this spot in Williamsburg recently — loved the focus on fermented ingredients and bold flavors like tahini and harissa. We had two market fish dishes and a few mezze, and the quality was definitely high. Everything tasted super fresh, thoughtfully prepared, and unique.\nThat said, portions were on the small side for the price (we spent around $90–$100), so just keep that in mind. When we asked if the mezze came with sourdough, the waitress said yes, but then the owner(I assume) asked us to order it separately ($5). Not a big deal, but small gestures like that could go a long way in making guests feel more welcome.\nThe biggest downside was the noise — it was really loud inside, which made it hard to relax or have a proper conversation. Overall, we loved the food but probably wouldn’t come back just because of the atmosphere.",

The doors were open on this nice day, and we enjoyed a great breeze flowing through.\n\nI had the drink of the day, a blood orange spritz, and it was solid. The food? Also, a win. The chicken shawarma was layered with flavor, so so good. I’ll definitely be coming back for it again. The pita? Fresh, fluffy and just right.\n\nBonus points for accepting InKind and Blackbird. That alone sealed the deal for a return visit.",

If you’ve never had it, imagine a piece of beef that has been brined, marinated, and slow-cooked for hours until it becomes as tender as butter, then finished with a deep, glossy caramelization of papelón that gives you that slightly charred, smoky sweetness. It is the kind of dish that stops conversation at the table, an art piece with soul.\n\nAnd everything else? Perfection with nostalgia woven in.\nThe plantains, the mini cachapas, the tequeños, and a pan de jamón so good it could make your abuela cry, warm, tender, slightly sweet, salty, comforting. Every plate felt like someone was inviting us into their home, letting us taste the food their family grew up on, the food that fills the kitchen on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nCasa Ora is full of heart. You can feel the love, the purpose, the passion in every corner, not just in the dishes but in the way the team carries themselves. It is rare to find a place that feeds you and moves you at the same time.\n\nThis is the restaurant you will rave about.\nThe one you will bring friends to, brag about, and keep thinking about long after you leave.\n\nAn unforgettable meal, and a perfect birthday.\nThank you, Casa Ora. 💛",

The decor is very similar, with plants everywhere coming from the ceiling. The temperature inside was very good. Fans inside give a breeze and not too cold.\n\nThe food was exceptional. I have the spicy lamb burger, with no English muffin and it came with really good fries and sauce for everything. The burger was perfect it was tender but firm and the goat cheese was not raw which is usually the down side of ordering a burger with goat cheese.\n\nMy boyfriend says he liked the eggs Benedict and it was “fire” and he “wants to stay here”. (Not sure what that means exactly) Unfortunately rooftop isn’t opened. Only on weekends.\n\nThe drinks are good too we had Bloody Maria with tequila, one with Mexcal and Rose.\n\nOur waiter was Diego. He was amazing on point and very friendly. He had at least ten tables and he isn’t breaking a sweat.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend it and also go on the weekend so you can go the rooftop.",

Eggs were done perfectly, soft scrambled, bacon crispy, potatoes were a little too salty, and the shakshuka was a little disappointing, like salsa with pouched eggs, but the bread was crisp and yummy when dipped into the bowl. However, the Sunday pancake was amazing. It’s was like a mini fluffy yellow cake with delicious buttered maple all over. not a maple taste but like a chocolaty buttery nutty flavor. “It was like a reward”. We enjoyed it the most. Overall we understand the hype and definitely recommend to try it for yourself.",

A total must-try (and so generous we couldn’t even finish it!).\n\nAlso ordered the warm grain bowl, and it arrived in what felt like 5 minutes — unbelievably fast service. The bowl itself was pure comfort: warm, rich, and beautifully balanced. The eggs were cooked like a soufflé — soft and melting — topped with a gigantic half avocado and a generous handful of pepitas (which I love and rarely see done this well). The rice underneath was so delicious.\n\nFinished with a cappuccino, served instantly in a lovely porcelain cup — the perfect touch to end brunch.\n\nOur server was incredibly kind and attentive, checking in often to make sure everything was perfect. Honestly, one of the best brunch experiences we’ve had in",

This place absolutely exceeded every expectation.\n\nWe ordered the tabouli, beets salad, hummus with meat, arayes, and sea bream a la plancha, and every single dish was phenomenal. The tabouli was fresh and perfectly seasoned, the beets salad had incredible depth of flavor, and that hummus with meat was next level - rich, creamy, and satisfying. The arayes were crispy and flavorful, but the real star was the sea bream a la plancha - cooked to absolute perfection with a beautiful char and tender, flaky interior.\n\nWhat I loved most is how healthy everything felt without sacrificing any flavor. You can tell they use quality ingredients and prepare everything with care. The flavors were vibrant, authentic, and incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe journey from Manhattan was 100% worth it - this is the kind of meal that reminds you why great food is worth traveling for. Can't wait to come back and try more of their menu. Highly, highly recommend to anyone looking for exceptional Mediterranean cuisine!",

The food was very delicious and reasonably priced. We ordered 4 small plates - babaganoush, falafel in tahina sauce, Labneh and Matboucha (tomato and garlic with hot green peppers) which came with fluffy Pitta. Arayes was a lamb main. The staff were super hospitable and attentive. The main took long to come out but the staff more than made up for it by giving us a complimentary hummus and pitta and half off the main dish. Definitely recommend this place.",

Everything was incredibly fresh, flavorful, and perfectly executed. The bread alone was amazing.\n\nThe service was impressively fast — we were served in under ten minutes — without ever feeling rushed. We started with wine, then had coffee, and I finished with a cocktail, which was excellent as well. Every part of the experience flowed seamlessly.\n\nWe sat at the bar, which added to the experience. The staff was extremely kind and attentive, the atmosphere felt cozy yet refined — luxurious without being over the top. You can really feel the quality and care in every detail. Even the restrooms were spotless.\n\nAn impeccable experience from start to finish. I will definitely come back and highly recommend this place without hesitation.",

I waited over 45 minutes for one course to the next. That definitely ruined the experience for me but I won’t go as far as to give 3 stars being that there was no rudeness or any attitude problems with the staff. Simply just slow and forgetful service. The burger was assembled in a way where the ingredients will slip out which you can’t even enjoy the experience, but flavor wise it was good. The best thing to me surprisingly was the chicken sandwich. Great flavor,texture, and not super messy to eat. The pancakes were mid I didn’t like the overly runny yet grainy texture. Not inedible or anything, I just expected a lot better flavor and texture from it. Overall the chicken sandwich itself and the quality of food just gets them to a 4 star for me. If it was out of 10 I’d give this spot a 7 really to be fair. But yea try it out yourself and maybe your experience will be better who knows.",

We noticed that there were at least two open tables the entire time we were there. We waited a long time for menus and for someone to ask for our drink orders. I asked for a menu due to waiting so long time and was told by the same person as before that the bartender would handle us. The bartender didn’t show up for the first 30 mins were seated. When a different server finally took our order, she rushed us and asked if we wanted her to come back when we were ready to order but it was like a 30 second pause in ordering so not long at all. The space was very cramped and hard to feel comfortable in. People kept bumping into me while I was eating. The food was good although nothing super special and between the negative vibe from the servers and the tight space, the experience was very poor.",

The highlight of the meal was the appetizers- the lamb tartar was really good but it was extremely greasy and did not have enough to cut on the oil and grease.\n\nI was not a fan of the baba ganoush and the smoked hamachi crudo. The hamachi was extremely fishy and did not taste fresh at all. The lamb could have had more flavor, and the brick chicken was dry.\n\nthe ambiance was really nice though with the dim lighting!\n\nThe apple olive oil cake was pretty dense as well. It was too dense and not light enough- what we thought an olive oil cake should taste like.\n\nThe service was great though. Overall it was decent, was not too impressed for the price.

The sauce with it was really good. It seemed like a typical fast food taco place. Also, the tacos are really small like 2 bites.",

I had a really great drink of their cocktail menu, switched to a margarita that I didn't like as much, and ordered tacos. The bartender explained the top three on the menu (chicken, fish, and something else) were the crowd-friendly ones and the really fun ones were at the bottom of the list.\nI went safe and it was fine, but his words echoed in my mind. You only live once so I ordered the beef tongue and the beef head or whatever it's called. The tongue was good, I would eat it again, but the beef head was *incredible*, so spicy, so good! A must-eat-again taco",

Been coming for years and have recommended to many people. Comfort food vibe, my fav is the chilaquiles. However the food isn't 100% consistent imo or maybe they got a new main line cook or something. Delicious free chips and salsa and super affordable for NYC. Great for food w friends and drinks, I like brunch the best because of the chilaquiles but do not go next door, this place has 10x better food though it looks nicer next door\nCheck them out!!!",

The rooftop view is stunning, especially during golden hour and after sunset when the city lights come alive. It’s a great spot for both casual drinks and more dressed-up occasions.\n\nThe cocktails were excellent — well-crafted and balanced. I ordered a few signature drinks and was impressed by the presentation and flavor. They also offer a good selection of wine and spirits. The vibe was energetic without being too loud, and the music added to the overall ambiance without overpowering conversations.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, even though the place was busy. Staff made sure we were comfortable, and everything was brought out in a timely manner. There’s a mix of indoor and outdoor seating, but I highly recommend grabbing a spot outside if the weather’s good.\n\nWhether you’re visiting NYC or live here and want a chic rooftop experience with great drinks and views, Monarch Rooftop is definitely worth it. I’ll be back for sure!",

Staff did good job in cleaning the snow. Igloos were well maintained & were heated. It was quite an experience to sit in a igloo & enjoy your drinks. FYI, your food & drink will be delivered in the igloo itself.\nRestaurant was just one level  below to the rooftop & it was spacious, clean & decorated well.\n\nI loved the food, specially avocado toast, fries & waffle.",

From the moment we arrived, it was clear that getting a table was the best decision we could have made. Having appetizers and a bottle delivered directly to our table as part of the package elevated the entire night and allowed us to relax and fully enjoy the celebration without fighting crowds. The layout was incredibly well thought out: despite being a packed NYE event, it never felt uncomfortably crowded. There were endless photo opportunities with the iconic skyline as the backdrop, making every moment feel special and memorable.\n\nThe energy throughout the night was electric. The DJs were phenomenal, keeping the vibe high and the party going nonstop. A huge shout-out to our waiter, Abu Karim, who was absolutely outstanding—attentive, professional, and on top of everything all night long. His service alone made the experience feel seamless and VIP. The open bar was fantastic, and the round rooftop igloos were such a cool touch—easy to access, warm, and perfect for enjoying drinks while taking in the views. Even better, they provided robes for guests who wanted to stay outside on the rooftop, proving that they truly thought of every detail.\n\nComing all the way from California, spending New Year’s Eve in New York City was a bucket-list dream—and this night at 230 Fifth was the cherry on top. From start to finish, it exceeded every expectation imaginable. Thoughtful planning, incredible atmosphere, top-tier service, and unforgettable memories made this a 10/10 experience. I would absolutely do it again without hesitation and highly recommend it to anyone looking to ring in the New Year in the most iconic way possible.",

Film experience \"kevin alone in NY\" was good! The Service was also good. The Manager gave us 1 popcorn for free, because of a mistake in describtion on the homepage eventbrite. There we have booked the tickets.\nThe only thing i missed was a cocktail card for specials we perhaps do not know in Europe :-) Was only online and there are many tourists from all over the world.\nWould spending time again at this beautiful place!

The perfect mix of light, sweet, and comforting.\n\nAfter the show I went up to the rooftop and the view took the night to another level. Beautiful skyline, great music, and such a good vibe overall.\n\nA perfect experience from start to finish. Highly recommend!",

The service was warm and attentive from start to finish, the food was outstanding with every dish full of flavor, and the atmosphere was simply perfect—relaxed yet vibrant. Cocktails are great, yummy cosmopolitan 🍸 What truly sets it apart is the view: the Empire State Building on one side, the Hudson River sunset on the other. It’s hands down one of the best spots in the city to enjoy an unforgettable evening. Can’t wait to come back!",

                "text": "The management at this establishment is truly incompetent. At first, they wouldn't let me in because I had a bag with me. I told them I could pay a fee and leave my bag at coat check, but they told me they didn't allow it. Then I left my bag at work and came back. When I went up to the rooftop and used the small camera I had to record the sunset, the security guard came and told me that shooting with cameras other than cell phones was prohibited. The biggest plus of this place is the view. If someone doesn't take beautiful photos of the view and share it, how will people find out and come here? The business rules are ridiculous and unreasonable. When you sit inside, you can't see clearly through the plastic mat. When you sit outside, it's difficult to see the full view from the seats and trees. Also, their food isn't very good.  I ordered the CHIMICHURRI CROQUETTES and they tasted pretty bad. The WAGYU BEEF SLIDERS were also pretty bland.",

During our last trip we booked another roof top & came to know not all places are allowed for kids. Staffs were nice inspite of their busyness. Heard this Magic Hour rooftop is part of Moxy hotel. Hence to skip the driving booked a room there for 2 days but didn’t realise there were different Moxy hotels in NYC. Had to drive and pay for parking separately.\n\nWasn’t over crowded since it was afternoon hour. My kid enjoyed & so did we!",

Loved how they had places where you could take photos. Could see this being a spot that you definitely go to for brunch with the girls to take them pics. The service was a little off, there was a period of time where our waitress had disappeared and we couldn’t get a few things that we needed. When we had booked this reservation we were excited to get a full experience cause we have stayed at the Moxy for a decade but never have been up to the rooftop for brunch . So once we sat down I knew I wanted to get the pancakes for sure . We were torn between the Crème brûlée french toast or the cotton candy pancakes. I am more of a pancake person than French toast. Once we got the pancakes , I realized that with the cotton candy alone was very very sweet. But on top of that the pancakes themselves were super dry, so I wasn’t impressed. Even after I had tried them several ways to see if one was better than the other, with just the cotton candy alone & syrup. One with the apples & syrup & one with the blueberries with syrup. No matter what I got super dry. My husband had with the the banana foster & enjoyed it. The eggs, bacon, home fries and salad was the plate I enjoyed the most! I will give that you definitely are paying for just the atmosphere. I would definitely go again and try a few other things before completely saying if I’d go back again or not. The music also was definitely created by millennials! All the songs were hitting.",

We paid $20 for the corner booth and you had no actual view from your seat (picture attached from sitting in my seat). Other tables you don’t even pay for had better views. You can still go outside and take a picture with it in the background, but you can do that anywhere. The food and service was typical bar food. It’s a nice atmosphere and trendy bar to hang out in but that’s really all. Also, it didn’t seem to be a problem to have a child at 5pm, we had one and another table had one about 7-10yrs old.",

From the moment we sat down, he was welcoming, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable. Beyond making excellent drinks, you can genuinely tell he is hardworking, driven, and truly passionate about the restaurant industry.\n\nTsenam took the time to connect with us, made thoughtful recommendations, and elevated the entire rooftop experience.

Once you go up the elevator and get off, you’re greeted with a very chic host area. I came on a Friday and had reservations for  4:30. We wanted to time our reservation for a sunset view. The views of the city are stunning and truly one of the focal points as soon as you walk in, which is great if you’re someone who loves a photo op. The space is very Instagramable.\nAfter we checked in with the hostess we were guided to the bar to order a drink while waiting for our table. The bar is very spacious with comfortable seating and friendly and attentive staff.\nOnce our table was ready we were brought over to a nice booth along the wall with a good view of the whole place. We were promptly greeted by our server, Johnathan. We had some questions about the menu that he answered with ease and even gave us good recommendations. I’m a dirty martini girl, but my mom and sister took his recommendations and absolutely loved their cocktails. We also ordered some food and I wish I could have eaten 10 more of the tuna rolls. They are delicious and I dream about them. I’ll just have to come back the next time I’m in New York.",

Nubeluz is known for its skyline views and modern atmosphere, and those elements definitely elevate the high tea. The moment you walk in, you’re greeted with a panoramic sweep of Manhattan that immediately sets a luxurious tone. The space feels contemporary and stylish, very different from the traditional settings you find in classic afternoon teas.\n\nThe food was excellent — thoughtful, refined, and visually impressive. The savory bites had clean flavors, and the pastries were delicate without being overly sweet. Everything tasted fresh, and the presentation added to the experience. The tea selection was also quite good, and the staff were helpful in guiding us through the choices. Service was attentive but relaxed, giving the experience a more modern lounge feel.\n\nCompared to The Ritz in London, the difference is clear but enjoyable in its own way. The Ritz is all about tradition, ceremony, and formality — the classic tiered trays, the live music, and the unmistakable old-world charm. Nubeluz, on the other hand, feels contemporary, sleek, and more playful. Instead of ornate décor and formal tea service, you get dramatic city views and a stylish, cosmopolitan vibe.\n\nThe Ritz London focuses on preserving an elegant ritual, while Nubeluz offers a reinterpretation of afternoon tea that fits New York’s energy. Both are excellent experiences, but they appeal to different moods: the Ritz when you want classic refinement, and Nubeluz when you’re in the mood for something modern with a bit of sparkle.\n\nOverall, high tea at Nubeluz is a beautiful, delicious, and uniquely New York experience, and it stands strong even when compared with iconic high teas abroad.",

The presentation was beautiful — fresh sandwiches, warm scones, and a lovely selection of pastries, The small bites were delicious and paired perfectly with the drinks.\n\nThe tea was fragrant and perfectly brewed, with plenty of flavors to choose from. The atmosphere was elegant and relaxing, and the staff were attentive and friendly, making the whole experience feel special. A perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a classy, delicious afternoon tea. Definitely a must-visit spot for amazing experiences and unforgettable view.",

The views were beautiful all around, and going to the Edge prior allowed us to see all angles. The food was delicious (we did the Prix Fixe window seating). The scallops, porterhouse, and dark chocolate soufflé were delectable. The drinks were solid, though I definitely liked my second one more (Cosmo Colada tastes a bit like Fruity Pebbles). I will say there was no soap in the bathroom when I went, but fortunately I carry a hand sanitizer at all times. It was quite the experience, and I’d definitely return!",

The space offers ample table seating along with a full bar set at the center of the room, allowing the skyline to remain the star no matter where you sit.\n\nThe decor is clean, modern, and refreshingly not stuffy. Arrival sets a strong tone, with smooth check-in and welcoming hosting that immediately elevates expectations. Service throughout the meal is solid and professional, though it doesn’t quite sustain the same level of attentiveness established at the start, especially given the premium setting.\n\nFortunately, the food carries its weight. The self-described New American menu is thoughtfully composed and broadly appealing, offering something for a wide range of tastes from elevated seafood dishes to a honest-to-goodness burger and fries, all without feeling diluted. Dishes are attractively plated, with flavors that feel bright, current, and familiar in the best way.\n\nPeak offers both prix fixe and à la carte menus for lunch and dinner, along with raw bar add-on options that add flexibility to the experience. It’s a restaurant that successfully balances spectacle and substance, making it a strong choice whether you’re visiting for the view, the food, or both, especially on a beautiful clear day/evening.",

It's especially nice to sit outside on a warm day but inside it's a wine bar, coffee bar, market and purveyor of the most delicious Italian sandwiches. The smoked salmon tartine will make you give up bagel lox and cream cheese. The schiacciate are packed with wonderful Italian meats and cheeses. Try brunch and have an exceptional mimosa. Coffees are perfect. Service is graceful. This is the Italian café of your dreams right in the West Village.",

As soon as we walked in the host/waitress seemed annoyed to greet or seat us even though the restaurant was 80% empty. She was rude throughout the entire service, she clearly didn’t want to be there. On top of that their payment systems starts the tip setting at 20%. I should be tipping minimum 20% for non-existent scornful service?\n\nThe food and wine is delicious. The crostini and the crepes were super tasty. This place needs to improve their service if they want patrons back.",

I went on a Friday night in December and the energy was delightful. The bread was very memorable, different variations of delicious carbohydrates. I don’t drink so the server recommended a lemonade, which was cute. For entrées, we all shared the octopus, roast beef, and couscous, each dish was was prepared to perfection and presentation was bright and delightful. Highly recommended!!!",

The curved ceiling and thin walls amplified sound, making it difficult to hear the one you were dining with.\n\nService was fine, attentive, but not at the level you’d expect from the people behind Frenchette and Le Veau d’or. It was clear it was all hands on deck, but that left the bathroom a mess and missed opportunities for real hospitality.\n\nThe food was priced somewhat high for what it was — it lacked the richness French cuisine should have but the menu items did have the nostalgic comfort diner food brings. The Alfredo and rice and beans were charming!\n\nWhat they did do right was the martini, but you can find many a good martini in Manhattan and with more intimate atmosphere and hospitable service.",

The place feels intimate and relaxed, with a beautiful open kitchen vibe and a great selection of wines by the glass. I love that they focus on small producers — you can actually taste the care in every pour.\n\nThe staff were super friendly and knowledgeable, and helped me pick a wine I probably wouldn’t have chosen on my own — and it was perfect. I also tried their warm Jerusalem bagel with labneh and it was insanely good. Simple, fresh, and just what you want alongside a good glass of wine.\n\nIt’s the kind of spot you want to keep secret but can’t stop telling people about. Definitely coming back, maybe even before my next dinner at Shmoné next door.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re looking for a laid-back, well-curated wine bar with a personal touch.",

The park has a beautiful waterfall and a stunning lake surrounded by vibrant fall colors. I did a short 30-minute trek to reach the top viewpoint instead of driving directly to the sunset spot  and the view was spectacular 😍😍\nThe scenery from above was truly breathtaking, especially during fall. I didn’t have much time to explore the whole park, but even the little I saw was amazing. Highly recommend visiting if you love nature and want a peaceful escape from the city! 🌿🍁🏞️",

Very scenic views that don’t require serious hiking effort, just slight inclines and declines.\nNatural beauty of Shawangunk Mountains here is supplemented by road building prowess of preserve’s founders and is the reason that we still have the park available now to thousands of daily visitors at a modest fee. Many grand historic hotels of Catskills don’t exist anymore including burnt out Cliff House and Windmere hotels previously located at shores of Lake Minnewasca till 1970s, so really glad that conservation efforts have succeeded here.\nNew visitor center and expansive parking lots are huge improvement over park’s facilities of just six years ago.",

The parking lot was spacious and not crowded — definitely past the peak season — and parking was $10. The weather was a bit chilly, but the fall colors were still beautiful.\n\nAt first, I took the UA trail toward Castle Point, but it was mostly gravel and not very exciting. Later I switched to the BR trail, which was better, though I hardly saw anyone the entire time — maybe fewer than five people total.\n\nThe hike itself felt a bit monotonous; even on the way down, it was just gravel again, so I ended up jogging down. I remembered Gertrude’s Nose being much more interesting and scenic in comparison.\n\nI stopped by the Falls at the end, but honestly, it wasn’t something I’d go out of my way to see again. Overall, it’s a decent hike for solitude and views, but not one I’d rush to repeat — especially considering it takes around 5 hours round trip.",

The trail around the lake is easy and scenic. The cabins in Berry pickers allow you to explore them without being behind a fence. The visitor center has some nice exhibits for kids, helpful hints for your hike, restrooms, and a water filling station.\n\nIn fall, the leaves are amazing of course. But the red leaves of high bush blueberries against pitch pine are absolutely stunning.",

The fall is the prettiest!\nto enter, you need a reservation, which opens two weeks before the desired day at 9 AM, which I think is amazing, since you don't have to worry about parking or getting there super early and stay in line just to make sure you're getting in.\n\nthe first viewpoint is about 15-20 min from the parking lot, and it's the prettiest of all.\nI highly recommend checking the ice cave trail as well is a very cool and fun trail, time-wise it will take you at least one hour.",

There's is a $10 fee to park that you pay up at the visitors center unless you have the Empire State Pass.\n\nThe hike itself was great. There's a decent uphill stretch but you'll reach the top with great views (about 20mi give or take from the parking lot)\n\nThere are some stone stairs you can take as a shortcut to to the Sam's Point lookout but the path goes straight to too.\n\nFrom there you can walk a little under a mile to get to Lake Maritanza or the path to the ice caves.\n\nThe ice caves were pretty amazing, perfectly cool on a warm late summer day. Be sure to have good shoes as there are some rocky scrambles and a few ladders to climb up.",

I walked a bit along the Shore Trail and enjoyed how peaceful it felt, especially with the sound of the water right beside the path. It’s a nice mix of shade, scenery, and spots to stop and take photos.\n\nThe lookout points along the drive were beautiful too. Each one gives a different perspective of the river and the city in the distance. It’s amazing how quickly you can go from a busy area to such a quiet, natural escape.",

But halfway through, a sudden flood storm came rolling in. The skies turned dark, rain poured down, and we even heard the emergency sirens go off three times.\n\nThe trail, already challenging with its boulder scrambles and steep terrain, became even more intense in the rain. It was tough, slippery, and at times a little nerve-wracking, but also incredibly exhilarating. The waterfall at Peanut Leap was stunning, especially with all the extra rainfall, and the views of the Hudson were dramatic and unforgettable.\n\nThis hike is no joke, especially in unexpected weather. But if you’re up for an adventurous challenge and come prepared, it’s an experience you’ll never forget. Just be sure to check the forecast—and maybe have an exit plan just in case!",

It is dog friendly but not all dogs are comfortable walking over the bridge.

Lake loop may be most photogenic one. If you like ridge hiking, Highlands trail (blue) is a good option with loops made via crossing red or orange trails. One of the most challenging (and rewarding) is Bare Rock trail (orange) leading to sweeping viewpoint over Greenwood lake. There are other areas of the park worth exploring. I like also Indian Hill section of the state park,  Blue Lake and Four Corners pond area.",

                "text": "Sterling Lake, named for the silvery barked beach trees in this area, is located off Sterling Mine  Road on Old Forge Rd. I must admit, it's somewhat confusing the way the nearby lakes are named. We are referring to Sterling Lake. There are also Little Sterling Lake and Sterling Forest Lake(also called Blue Lake on the IBM Corporate Office Park. IBM's nickname is \"Big Blue\"). Mining for iron in this area was taking place before the Revolutionary War. The links of chain across the Hudson River to prevent British warships from sailing past West Point were made in the original foundry at Sterling Mine. It was intended to halt progress of warships. Cannon placements in West Point and strategic hill tops would lob cannon shot  down onto the stranded vessels. This was a physically impractical engineering design the chain failing under its own weight. And British naval strategists knew how risky a notion it would be to travel up the Hudson River while the Continental Army held such a strategic and formidable fortress. It was a stalemate. But the mines held an important place for it made the weapons needed to win the war.\nMine shafts travel under thIs lake. It is a watershed. It's clean water is part of the Hudson Highlands Watershed and provides water for reservoirs below it. Hiking, mountain biking and cross country skiing trails are available for use in this 20,000 acre park. The Frank Lautenburg Visitors Center and parking area sits on a prominence on the south side of the lake. You could hike the lake and many connected trails from here or take a short walk to see the restored  original blast furnace or crumbling remains of later iron works operations.  But now to the present.  Last year, two climate related events devastated Sterling Forest and its trails are closed indefinitely. There is no time line for remediating damage here. A May, 2024 violent change of season storm brought the jet stream tumbling to earth, which destroyed the forest as though it was a clear cutting operation. We spoke to  a sawyer by the visitors center. Brian was his name and he told us to look at his YouTube videos of what he does. Just Google Brian NV to see his videos. He hikes miles into the woods to open trails with  a chain saw. Then, on November 9, 2024, after a long drought, the Jenkins fire scorched the area. It was a quick moving forest fire that may actually be beneficial to old growth trees by removing underbrush that can choke and rob these trees of nutrients. But it's a nice ride to get here and see the big blow down and mine operations and visitor center displays of dioramas, mine artifacts and wildlife.",
